0,1351123200,B003XPF9BO,A3R7JR3FMEBXQB,5,where does one  start...and stop... with a treat like this,Wanted to save some to bring to my Chicago family but my North Carolina family ate all 4 boxes before I could pack. These are excellent...could serve to anyone
1,1351123200,B003JK537S,A3JBPC3WFUT5ZP,1,Arrived in pieces,"Not pleased at all. When I opened the box, most of the rings were broken in pieces. A total waste of money."
2,1351123200,B000JMBE7M,AQX1N6A51QOKG,4,"It isn't blanc mange, but isn't bad . . .","I'm not sure that custard is really custard without eggs.  But this comes close.  I got it for use in a ""Vegan pancake"" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!<br />However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.<br /><br />If you want a really good egg-free ""custard"" get an original recipe for ""blanc mange.""  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference."
3,1351123200,B004AHGBX4,A2UY46X0OSNVUQ,3,These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.,"I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.  There are 7 nice big chunks in every jar.<br /><br />These taste like tuna in a can but, because they're preserved in glass, you don't have to worry about either aluminum or BPA; BUT ... they are not just tuna and spring water.<br /><br />There is salt in there, too, and it's not healthy sea salt, it's toxic table salt.<br /><br />I am trying to contact Tonnino to confirm that.  I might be wrong because the label states that the ingredients are ""tuna fish"" but the sticker on the top clarifies that it is the smaller (healthier) yellowfin, so the ""salt"" listed in the ingredients might be sea salt but, if it was, why don't they say so?<br /><br />Without confirmation, I will continue to look for a salt-free olive-oil free tuna preserved in glass.<br /><br />If you know of one, please contact me!"
4,1351123200,B001BORBHO,A1AFOYZ9HSM2CZ,5,Happy with the product,My dog was suffering with itchy skin.  He had been eating Natural Choice brand (cheaper) since he was a puppy.  I was nervous to change foods.  The vet suggested to change foods sand see if the skin issues cleared up.  Wellness brand did the job.  My dog seems to love the food and the skin issues cleared up within a few weeks.
5,1351123200,B008PSM0BQ,A3OUFIMGL2K6RS,4,Good Sauce,"This is a good all purpose sauce.  Has good flavor that the heat doesn't overpower.  Not really that spicy unless you use a whole bunch.  10 good drops is about enough to add a little heat to a pot of soup, but a lot more is needed if you want a lingering burn.  Heat isn't quite up to par with other products out there, (such as Spontaneous Combustion) but this has the true aged cayenne hot sauce flavor."
6,1351123200,B008YA1LQK,A9YEAAQVHFUTX,5,Blackcat,Great coffee!  Love all Green Mountain coffee and all the wonderful flavors.  Would and do recommend this coffee to all my friends.
7,1351123200,B001KP6B98,ABWCUS3HBDZRS,5,Excellent product,After scouring every store in town for orange peels and not finding anything satisfactory I turned to the online options.<br /><br /> I received the candied orange peels today and I found exactly what I was looking for. The peels are perfect for the fruit cake I plan to bake. The peels are not crystallized with sugar which is great  I like the texture and the taste of the peels and I am gonna order another box soon.
8,1351123200,B008YA1LQK,A2RSB6FVQ9K9OD,5,Bulk k-Cups,This is the best way to buy coffee for my office. Least expensive way to buy convenience with harder to find flavor and brand.  I also buy this way for home.
9,1351123200,B001E5E2QI,A23WYVBCNE75X1,3,It's Okay,"Next time, I will buy Gevalia Irish Cream decaf coffee.  I thought this would be as good, but it's mostly sugar."

11,1351123200,B004QDA8WC,ANM000BVVUSCT,5,"Exactly what I was looking for: Fast, fantastic Chai!","I was skeptical as to how good an all-in-one Chai Tea for Keurig could be, but my doubts were erased at my first sip!  The spice blend is great, as is the sweetening and the dairy component.  This is the kind of thing I was hoping I could get from my single-serve coffeemaker!<br /><br />Order some, you will thank yourself every time you brew a cup."
12,1351123200,B000K8T3OQ,AK43Y4WT6FFR3,1,Broken in a million pieces,"Chips were broken into small pieces. Problem isn't amazon's, it's Stacy's. Stacy (or amazon) needs to pack the original box of six better, the bags move around too much. There was room for at least two more bags in the box.<br />Amazon packed the Stacy's box in their box very tight and good.<br /><br />I tried to complain to Stacy, they make it very hard, no luck.<br />Chips taste great though, maybe I'll pour them in a bowl with milk for breakfast."
13,1351123200,B0051C0J6M,AWFA8N9IXELVH,1,Deceptive description,On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.
14,1351123200,B0051C0J6M,AG4YGLLIE8BWP,5,Makes me drool just thinking of them,"The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions...<br />Get them while you can...  Their other flavors are great tooo"
15,1351123200,B003J9HAU2,A23WYVBCNE75X1,3,it's alright,My kitten prefers Kitten Chow or Iams.  He leaves it in his bowl unlike other brands I have purchased in the past.
16,1351123200,B001444G5Q,A3FIA99WOIL40T,2,these are mini candy bars.,I was very disappointed with this order because no where on the description did it say that these were mini candy bars. If you don't want mini's DO NOT BY THIS PACKAGE!!!! Now I have to spend more money because it would cost a ton of money to send these back and I'm not going to give out mini's to trick or treaters.
17,1351123200,B006Q7YG24,A7EU2BWLLCJY2,5,My dogs love them!,"I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies."

The cats weren't thrilled with the food, but I stuck with it anyway.  In October, I took one of the cats to vet for weight loss and hair loss.  After various testing, the vet proposed the problem was this food.  I don't know why it made one of the cats so sick and not the others, but I am very upset that I caused my cat to become ill by switching her food.  I am throwing out the rest of this food immediatetly."
25,1351123200,B004F7EFVE,A24UHAYXKSS3AP,5,Yum,My kids love these Earnest Eats snacks. I like that they are more nutritional and healthier that traditional snack bars in the grocery store. I also admire the use non-oil alternative products such as almond butter and non-processed sugar such as dried fruit for sweetness. I have already ordered these bars 3 times and will continue!

30,1351123200,B001EQ5MT8,A1LZ8VQVNPI30N,5,Better than you-know-who's coffee...,"So my wife is a latte freak, and nursing, so decaf is the approved type.  After the Senseo left the market, I struggled and found the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK"">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> which is like a French Press for the 21st century.  After getting our recipe figured out, my wife, who's been buying Venti Decaf Latte's at $4 a pop almost daily for years now declares that Seattle's best Level 3 Decaf in her home-made Latte is the best coffee she can get.  We've tried other bands, and this is her favorite, hands down!"
31,1351123200,B004X8TGVY,A3HQAPXAJV7PRX,5,Like Triscuits but healthier,"We have bought a lot of Kashi Heart to Heart crackers since DH had a heart attack last year, but we've never tried the originals. I didn't realize it, but these are the woven wheat type of cracker like Triscuits, not crackers like the other ones we've been buying. They are not as salty as Triscuits (or they couldn't claim to be heart-healthy), but if you make heart-healthy spreads to put on them using flavorful salt substitutes, you won't miss the salt. They can be used for everything you'd use Triscuits for. I'm really glad these are available."
32,1351123200,B007OSBEV0,A2HE0D04TNG6CS,1,Disappointed,I received the offer from Amazon and had never tried this brand before.  I thought since Martinson's had been in business for a long time that I would order.  I was disappointed.  The flavor was not what I expected and each cup of coffee had a residue in it. I have not had any of the other brands do that so I know it had to be the coffee.  I am guessing that the coffee was ground to fine for a K-Cup.  I only have 8 more left and will be glad.  I will not buy this brand again.
33,1351123200,B003EML8PM,A3VERUHFCZ5S51,5,Ms. Mac's Review,I loved this item.  I wish I could find it in the stores.  Walmart carried this item in Louisiana for some time. When I travel to Louisiana I sometime can find this item at Fred's.  I have not found this item in the Houston area.  Easy to prepare and a great conversation piece.  No one here has seen this before.  I purchased this item at Amazon.
34,1351123200,B007OSBEV0,A2WMWK5GJCY8SH,5,Good coffee.,This is the best Donut Shop Blend out there.  Though most k-cups taste a little freeze dried.  Keurig needs to work on that.  I prefer San Francisco Bay Coffee Company.
35,1351123200,B000VDL7RG,A2QGTXLC93BRV9,4,Good but not as good as I remember,"I could be wrong but it seems like these used to be better. After reading reviews I think something went down in quality once BIGS took over production but with that said, these are still good sunflower seeds and addicting. There was an abundance of seeds that looked like they were smashed together or had gotten a ton of whatever the seasoning was glued onto them in a glob but at least 90% of each package was the normal single seed, non-misformed kind. All in all these are worth buying if you like sunflower seeds but if you have had them before BIGS was outsourced to produce them you may be a little disappointed as I was as they went from great to good."
36,1351123200,B003U9TAH2,A1QA6BI0T8A81I,5,Very good,"It tastes delisious, and works efectively if yo drink it at the rigth time. Lean body is the suplement with the best flavor I've ever tasted"
37,1351123200,B000FBM3RC,A2XVOWD40JCFSZ,4,yummy cookies!,We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh.
38,1351123200,B0076YVPFC,A23E9ZPS2RQZS0,5,Tasty and Quick Pasta,"Barilla Whole Grain Fusilli with Vegetable Marinara is tasty and has an excellent chunky vegetable marinara.  I just wish there was more of it.  If you aren't starving or on a diet, the 9oz serving is enough for lunch although you might want to add a piece of fruit to feel full.  The whole grain fusilli cooked to al dente tenderness following the instructions and the chunky marinara sauce is so good that I wished there was more of it.  Rarely do I eat sauce alone but this sauce is good enough to."
39,1351123200,B0076YVPFC,A3FD3BHIUYIFPD,3,Handy,"Love the idea of ready in a minute pasta and for that alone this product gets praise.  The pasta is whole grain so that's a big plus and it actually comes out al dente.  The vegetable marinara sauce is tasty, but has a high salt content - 710mg for a 9 oz. serving.<br /><br />It looks like much thought and testing went into creating the packaging, but I found it challenging.  You need to pull back the film to expose the sauce tray -- and not spill it.  I had to pull hard on the film, which made the sauce cup wiggle.  Easy to work around, but tricky nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all a step up from usual microwave in a minute fare."
40,1351123200,B005VUILWI,A1X2LENOF84LCQ,3,sweet enough for me but is not all stevia,"I feel it is sweet enough for me but I am trying to tame my sweet tooth and cutting back on sweets. I don't like that it has the agave in it, It is not something I am interested in using on a regular basis. There is some controversy it seems over how good agave really is for your body. I am looking for a natural sweetener that is good for you and tastes good. I am not completely convinced that this is what I want. Everyone has there own tastes and can make their own decisions. This is just my opinion."
41,1351123200,B005VUILWI,AS44QEHT3KSPK,3,ok....not the best,"I've tried a lot of stevia - not sure why this has agave or silica but then again, the last stevia I bought had lactose listed first, then stevia leaf.<br /><br />The taste is good and it dissovles fast, but I wish it was just pure stevia."
42,1351123200,B003M60630,AJVDF84AZB2OU,5,Celestial Iced Black Tea,This is my favorite brand of black iced tea. I have tried others and they don't compare to the flavor of Celestial Seasons.
43,1351123200,B0000CNU0B,A27ZW7Y1XVK473,5,Great stuff,I use this to make a broth for noodles and soup. it reminds me of the days I spent in Japan. easy to use.
44,1351123200,B004SC56MS,A212SRA4Z8BNJY,5,Very pleased,"Good size for my papillon and pomeranian-mix.  These are dense, not airy- so they last longer and from the USA."
45,1351123200,B0076YVPFC,A3OJX18B60PJR9,4,"Tasty & convenient but  at $3.21 a package, not the best value available","Daverat's Wife speaking:  I made this for my husband and it was very easy to prepare in the microwave.  He enjoyed the meal and stated that he'd love to have them on hand if the price point was more reasonable.  He ate his  Fusilla & Veg Marinara with a large salad seasoned only with some balsamic vingar and had it for his dinner meal.  To use the Chinese food cliche, he told me an hour later he was hungry again so I made him a grilled chicken breast.  That got me to thinking that the packaged meal alone wouldn't work for us as a stand-alone  meal.  We'd have to add to it for it to work.  If these were a dollar per package cheaper after Subscribe & Save, they might make a good shelf stable meal to which you could add cooked chicken strips, canned chicken, black beans or even a high quality pouched tuna.  On it's own, it's not filling enough nor nutritionally complete.<br /><br />Right at this moment, Amazon is showing me an offer for a $5 off Amazon coupon which when applied, brings the price point after Subscribe & Save down to $2.38, which is  quite a bit better and rather tempting.  However, after seeing this, I asked my husband if he wanted me to order some for the pantry and suddenly he wasn't as in love with the product any more.  Oh well!  When you add in the cost of a small salad plus some lean protein such as the gilled chicken breast, even with the $5 off, it brings the per meal cost back up to around $4.60.  That may sound like a bargain if you eat out often or grab fast food a few nights a week but we don't.  I plan our meals out for the week and even sometimes for an entire month ahead of time to get the most from every grocery item we buy and I could make this same dish using Barilla High protein pasta, my own vegetable marinara with veg from my gardens and come out quite a bit cheaper.  I also think I could eliminate some of the high sodium contant and bring down the fat in the dish as well.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, however, because hubby liked it, it was simple to prepare and even a starving teenager can toss in some chicken strips of canned chicken to make it a more filling meal.  There's enough sauce in the meal to coat a moderate amount of added chicken or meat.  I could see this being a good pantry staple for a college student or a busy single person. As shelf-stable meals go, even though I wasn't all that impressed with the sodium count and fat, this brand compares quite favorable with other shelf-stable meals. It could be a good choice for folks in ned of something o brag and nuke quickly at the end of a long day and in place of ordering in restaurant food.  For a family on a budget.. not so much of a deal."

52,1351123200,B003U4M4ZC,A3V7HRQR1OQPQ7,5,An Authentic Movie Theater Popcorn Experience.,"My wife is a popcorn fanatic and especially  loves that Authentic  Movie Theater Popcorn.  I have been trying relentlessly to re-create that experience at home using various products, from clarified butter, to flavacol, to movie butter seasoning.. all of which came close but not exactly it.  After trying the Snappy Butter Burst Oil we agreed this was the closest we've tasted that fit that flavor profile of Authentic Movie Theater Popcorn.  Of course you have remember  to include the other steps as well , like cooking on the stove vs. a hot-air popper and cooking with coconut oil while also using fine-grained salt to top afterwards. (not regular table salt, the fine-grained salt gives much better coverage  ).<br /><br />I could not find any nutritional information on the product so here it is :<br />1 tablespoon Serving Size<br />Total Fat : 14g<br />Saturated Fat: 2g<br />Trans Fatty Fat: 0<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 8g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 4g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 0g<br />Protein: 0g<br /><br />Ingredients: soybean oil, Artificial Butter Flavor, TBHQ and citric acid, Beta Carotene<br /><br />Suggestion: purchase a pump for use with the gallon size or  , as we like to do,  use a cup with a pouring spout (measuring cup will do),  heat 1 - 2 tablespoons in microwave for 10-15 seconds and slowly pour warmed oil over popped corn ( layering in the popcorn to maximize coverage) .<br /><br />kick back and enjoy your favorite movie,  an episode of your favorite drama, or just enjoy the popcorn all to yourself - whatever suits your mood."
53,1351123200,B001NGAT9W,A111SHKHPDN8N,5,A Hit!,"We had an Autumn soup party a couple of weeks ago, featuring 3 different soups and different artisan breads.  The overwhelmingly favorite soup was the Illinois Prairie Corn Chowder.  It couldn't have been easier to prepare, and I added absolutely nothing to it (except the fresh corn, as recommended on the package) and it tasted fantastic.  Everyone wanted my soup recipe and were surprised when I revealed that it was an easy to make packaged soup.<br /><br />The package makes a lot of soup, about 12 servings.  Since I had a large group, I made up two packages.  We were able to send extra servings home with our guests, and still had plenty left over for ourselves.<br /><br />I saw a review that suggested adding some cooked bacon to the soup.  I'm going to try that next time, even though the package mix requires no extra flavoring.  I just like the flavor of bacon.<br /><br />I'd recommend this soup to anyone who likes corn, chowder, and a rich tasty soup."

My only issue was one of the bottles appeared<br />slighty ajar and the oil/liquid had slightly leaked out. The<br />product seemed well packed so I can only assume it may have<br />been roughed up by the delivery company. All things considered<br />giving this product five stars and I highly recommend."

The others have not been opened yet and I found this very upsetting since this is the part the the puppies go for first. I don't mind paying that price if it is as shown. The bag show no white only balls.<br />Theresa Miller
56,1351123200,B0084HNA80,AXJ1QYBUL86ON,3,This price is ridiculous!,"There's nothing wrong with variety, except when it comes at too high a price. If you want variety, go in with a friend on a few of the 9 bags for $26.01 deals that are offered for different flavors of Beanitos.  My favorite are the pinto bean with cheddar cheese variety.  I lost interest very quickly in the black bean and sea salt and chipotle barbecue flavors."

I cooked grilled chicken breasts, beef cooked every way, even lean pork chops...no deal...It is very grueling to watch your only baby starving!!! I tried 32 flavors of dog food. He has always preferred dry food over canned food. So I was perusing the dog food offered by my ""hero sight"" Amazon,and something about Halo Spots Stew caught my attention. For days I went back and forth between flavors that my pooch would find appealing. Finally, I settled on the adult lamb recipe. After ordering I thought ""Oh no, the kibble is going to be too large for his small mouth""( Am I neurotic, doting mother or what?) Anyone who thinks I am totally disgusting doesn't know what this situation is like!! I was prepared to chop the dog food in my food processor...BUT, the food arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and what a surprise!!!

59,1351123200,B0041CH4I4,A4BFKBO2SU9AX,4,Yummy & Great Small Gift,"If someone who will remain nameless would stop eating all mine, then I wouldn't have had to get the box of 20 Chimes ginger candy tins.  But I'm glad I did.  The packaging is cute, and makes a great small gift to hand out to a co-worker having a rough day, a client when you visit, or a friend when you stop by to watch the game.  The tins are recyclable in most locations.  The individually wrapped candies are made with cane sugar and real ginger, no high fructose corn syrup so they are in a way better for you than other candy options.  Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can settle a stomach and ease hearburn.  When's the last time your chocolate bar did that?"

This is my mainstay since it has great smooth and rich coffee flavor. It isn't acidy or bitter at all. Actually I like a little acidity so my favorite is to blend this with the Smoked Coffee offered on Coffee Bean Direct's website. Dark Sumatra makes the best base coffee for any blend that I've tried. Costa Rican Tarrazu won't stand on its own but will add just the right amount of acidity to make it my second best choice to blend with Dark Sumatra. If you want to discover the flavorful world of rich coffees, Dark Sumatra is the starting point, then start playing with it."

These are the exception - the yogurt coating on the bottom adds a very nice taste to the granola. Sweet, but not candy bar sweet. I prefer the strawberry over the vanilla, but both are good.<br /><br />The granola itself is soft but still holds together as a bar. The calorie count is decent (120 per bar). The nutritional content is not stellar, but reasonably good and much better than candy alternatives.<br /><br />Highly recommend, especially if you can get them on a price dip."

Please, whatever you do, don't get this particular package, because you will be horribly disappointed, unless you want the K-cups no one else would want or drink!! Yes, they are all different, but out of the 35 there I will only be drinking maybe 10 of them, the rest I will try to give away although I doubt anyone will want them!! Alot are decaf, which I don't drink, or they are tea or hot chocolate. I was hoping for actual flavored coffee, now I know to only order my K-cups from Keurig or I will buy them at the store!! I am sadly disappointed in this assortment of K-cups, and the person that packed my bag really did a HORRIBLE job!! Oh, and 4 of them are either empty, or the coffee in them is hard and stale!!"

These are a great value when you combine with free shipping. They have a very good taste and you wouldn't even guess that they are a gluten free cookie. My shipment arrived unbroken but I have bought in the store and they were crumbs. I love this product.

83,1351123200,B008HF0KS2,AWFA8N9IXELVH,1,Deceptive description,On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.

86,1351123200,B0083T6HC0,A20BV8REQQXB8R,5,VERY HAPPY!!!,"I ordered on the 23rd and it was deliverd 2 days later. It was in a brown paper bag, but placed in a box. I had 35 exactly and only 1 repeat. People complained of too much decaf or half-caff which I would like but only had 3 of those. Only two hot cocoa and two spiced cider. I loved the variety and looking forward to a whole new variety next time I order; and I will order again."
87,1351123200,B003CIBPN8,A2CUGPQKBWYTQH,5,Great taste!,The best coconut water...it is much better in the bottle than the paper box. I would recommend it. It even tastes great at room temperature.

My daughter came across them and loves them for a quick snack between her hectic schedule of classes & work. Most times she won't have time to eat a full meal and these are such a great alternative to fast food.  I will order again & this time I'll get a few for moi! Really loved the cranberry too..

This Nylabone stick is perfect.  It's durable and my pit likes the hollow stick-shape for some reason.  I think the bacon scent also attracts her.  I definitely would recommend this toy for anybody that has a big dog that loves to chew!
91,1351123200,B005DGIAMQ,AW7RYHDFTRUXM,4,Nylabone DuraChes,"Not as hard as the white Nylabone chews but my chewer likes it better. It clearly will last a long time. The cavity for placing food products is not useful as cleaning it is problematic and as it becomes chewed, is difficult to insert stuff. Overall it is a good chew stick."
92,1351123200,B0065AOUKK,A3KK7HD497XU5Z,5,will do it again,Service was great. Hot White Chocolate is awesome. I will be ordering again soon!! Even the family is hooked and wants some more to.

Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated. Day no 4 and I am still waiting for her ""full diaper""! I can see how much she is suffering trying to poop, I tried prunes and this product is still sitting in her little tummy. Waste of money! Disappointed in whole foods that they would sell such a bad product!"

It does, in fact, contain xylitol...but all the other terrible stuff as well, including aspartame.  I think that the item listing is misleading, or they have changed the formulation of this gum.  I'm disappointed that I could have purchased chemical gum at any local store.  Seller should make sure that the listing accurately describes the ingredients.  It has a good taste, and I will use it rather than spend the money to send it back, but it's not what I was looking for. I will stick with SPRY gum from now on.<br /><br />The seller did ship very quickly."

101,1351123200,B004OFAX5Y,A2UHAFWITF9JYP,5,Scriptures are incredible! Makes a SUPER tasty gift,"Thank you Shepherds Garden for a great product! The scriptures are well chosen, thoughtful. It really makes a perfect gift and accompaniment to quiet time (or any time!) As for flavor, compared to celestial seasoning's (non-organic) country peach passion, Shepherds is has soft peach tones and a more earthy flavor. Unless you're not a peach person or avid tea lover you should love it. It's organic too, which is VERY important for tea, and being a white tea it also contains less fluoride if that's a consideration for you. I got 5 boxes directly from their site for my mom, grandmom, sister, and friends this Christmas (great to pair w/ homemade breads or coffeecake!). If you don't think you'll dig peach they have a chai that's truly superior to any chai I've tasted, cranberry is good & unique, and peppermint just rocks (free samples at their website too...). No, they're not flavored with crazy artificial chemicals, sweeteners, non-organic leaves, and colorants. But I LIKE THAT! And for goodness sake they're Bible verse teas! How cool is that?!"

105,1351123200,B0032CJPOK,A1KG2FZQW58S2F,4,"It's not Mother's milk, but it's great formula!","After going back to work full-time, I really struggled with keeping up with nursing my baby full-time. I just could not meet the quota that baby wanted to consume through pumping, no matter how often I pumped, what supplements I took, what diet I had, etc. I started using the Enfamil samples they sent me in the mail before I had my baby. First of all, I was kinda disgusted with how yucky it smelled. Baby didn't seem to like it either and spit up most of it after drinking it. We went to try their formula for babies who are gassy and as I was waiting for it to warm up I read the ingredient label and was shocked to see that the very first ingredient was corn syrup solids. Really??? In infant formula? I know it needs to contain sugar but come on!<br />So that started me on a research binge and I found that all formulas have to have some sort of sugar in them, but the kind of sugar is what matters. Moms make lactose and glucose (although in smaller amounts than lactose) and there is also fructose and sucrose. Fructose is what they make from corn (AKA HFCS), and sucrose is what they use in artificial sweeteners. I voted primarily for lactose and glucose, but found that a lot of formulas focused on fructose and sucrose, and if they had glucose it was from brown rice (this was during the scare that rice had arsenic in it).<br />FINALLY I found Earth's Best. I was impressed that not only did it have lactose and glucose but glucose was the 4TH ingredient instead of the first or second. This was the most important point to me in purchasing, but even more important -was baby going to like it? When I mixed it the first time it didn't have a sour odor to it, and it smelled like milk (granted, as all formula, it smells after it sits for a while). It even looked like milk (hooray) AND baby gobbled it right up. ALL OF IT. She loves the stuff! Best part is there are no problems with transitioning from breast to bottle, so now she is supplemented with the formula after her fill of breast-milk when I'm home. She even gets excited to drink it!<br />I think there's something everyone needs to keep in mind. We don't live in a `clean' society any more. Everything has toxins and chemicals, you have to choose the lesser of two evils. Everything is bad in excess: sunshine can give you cancer, tap water can give you cavities and diseases and raw fruits and veggies can give you pesticides. Even air is bad for you, depending on where you live. So I say, do the best with what you have and don't let yourself get too carried away with all the hype about harmful stuff. In the end, I feel I made the right choice for my baby and chose the next best thing to breast-milk that I could find that was relatively affordable and easy to obtain."
106,1351123200,B0034EDMCW,A1Z42SO1EE4L02,5,Great Taste,I love the KIND bars.  They taste great and are much healthier than other bars.  Also they satisfy your taste for something sweet so are healthier than eating candy.
107,1351123200,B003VXFK44,A21VWSCGW7UUAR,4,"Good, but not Wolfgang Puck good","Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful."
108,1351123200,B006N3I0DM,AMUD7YJD0Y8D3,5,My new favourite for a nice bold morning brew,"When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU"">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4"">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's ""Big Easy Bold"").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed."
109,1351123200,B007JFXWRC,APVK8GGSSUDCE,5,A great caffeine-free tea!,"I like everything about Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea!  First of all, the box is very practical as it ""snaps"" closed to keep the tea bags fresh, which is always a good thing!  The picture on the box is appealing and shows what the flavor is to a ""tea"" (pun intended).  The pyramid tea bags are great for diffusion. And the flavor is wonderful!  You don't need to add sugar or sweetener but it tastes good either way.  Even a bit of honey can change the flavor but it's all good.<br /><br />I give this product 5 stars!"
110,1351123200,B007JFXWRC,A3U1S5KR287T3I,5,Yummy!,"I love this tea.  When I made it, it was a purplish color, and kind of strong.  If you wanted it weaker you might want to not let it steep as long as I did.  You can definitely make out both the blackberry and vanilla, and they blend very nicely.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it isn't unpleasant.  I made it hot, but didn't finish it and the air conditioning was on, so it got cold.  It was quite cold when I tried it for the second time, and it tasted great!  This is the type of tea I like drinking in the afternoon; I won't be switching my morning Lady Grey tea for this.<br /><br />I love the tea bag design.  With the pyramid tea bag I can see what the tea is, rather than look through an opaque square tea bag.  The tea tasted very fresh, too."
111,1351123200,B006N3I0DM,A2BAYRWJ9I0LLB,5,Emerils Big Easy,"Best coffee available, I drink it on the middle setting of the five our maker has and one cups is enough."
112,1351123200,B007JFXWRC,A17C7XZHFOS12W,2,not really my cup of tea,"I love tea!  I was hoping that this would be as tasty as it sounds-- blackberries! vanilla! caffeine free!  But... eh.  Sorry for the bad pun that I used for my title, but really-- it's not for me.  It smelled great in the box, so I guess that's another reason why I was so disappointed in its flavor.  I had it with honey, and it still wasn't very tasty.  The reason why I gave it two stars is that it does taste slightly better as an iced tea, but still, not something I'd routinely drink.<br /><br />As for the tea bags, they're really nice-- I love the shape and how sturdy they are.  I might have to try another one of Lipton Pyramid Teas."
113,1351123200,B007JFXWRC,A26TYDQ2BFD4EG,4,"I do not love it, but I like it.","Blackberry tea...vanilla tea...you like it or you don't. I like it because it's decaffeinated and easy on the throat. To me, the pyramids do not pose any steeping advantage but I do like how they don't come individually wrapped. I shudder to think of where all those envelopes went as I discarded them over the years.<br /><br />So if you're serious about your tea, by all means, go ahead. I do not love it, but I like it."
114,1351123200,B006W6YHV4,A27DIIBWR2ASZY,5,Crack for dogs.,These thing are like crack for dogs. I am not sure of the make-up but the doggies sure love them.
115,1351123200,B0076YVPKC,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,4,Fine for a microwave dinner,The Barilla Mezze Penne with spicy marinara sauce is easy to prepare and tastes better than similar products. The sauce is not as spicy as I expected it to be but does have a flavorful tomato-y taste. The sauce is separate from the pasta and must be combined after cooking.
116,1351123200,B007JFXWRC,A8KWNRQPZLAXC,4,"Nice flavor, pleasant tea","These triangle tea bags are small, so I thought they might make a weak herb tea.  But it's quite pleasant in flavor, not weak, not overpowering.  My taste buds first picked up the blackberry, with a candy-like flavor, followed by the vanilla.  Best flavor is experienced when the tea is allowed to cool 5 minutes before consumption.  I do not find a sweetener necessary in this tea."
117,1351123200,B007JFXWRC,A2QEZU2SHYBHM5,5,My wife liked it,I ordered this for my wife and she really liked it. The tea brews quickly with the more open bag that allows water to flow around it better. Excellent product with a full rich tea flavor as the end result.
118,1351123200,B007JFXWRC,A33LH3ROCD8AY4,4,Highly recommended.,Often times I find herbal teas either too weak or too overpowering.  This tea is a perfect blend.... Not too sweet or too tarte.
119,1351123200,B007R900WA,A14EIPV17IO55P,5,Excellent buy.,Ideal addition to Keurig coffee maker. This is our second one and this one was $10.00 cheaper. Will recommend to all our friends.
120,1351123200,B00015UC4S,A3J5U6VT5Z7IDU,2,not worth the money,"I works fine but unless you are a commercial producer the price is ridiculously high.  It's at least 10 times more expensive than corn starch, which has been successfully used for likelt hundreds of years w/o a problem.  I wouldn't buy it again"
121,1351123200,B001EO7FZO,A13GZCHAMKWYBT,4,Would be better packed in oil..,"These are good.  They are truly roasted and have that roasted flavor.  I would have given more stars if they weren't packed in water.  I was surprised at that.  I ended up draining the peppers thoroughly and putting in ziplock quart bags in the fridge.  Of course, only used one can because these are the big cans.  I use a bag at a time, saute in olive oil just to heat through with the herbs and spices that I intend for the meal. Excellent w/ Italian and other sausages and also had a cold pepper + olive oil salad.  I used one entire can within a week and a half for several good meals and it certainly saved time during this hot summer not having to roast and clean my own!"
122,1351123200,B0007OF0F4,A37M5ZMHCCSTN6,5,excellent steak and meat seasoning,"The Lynchburg seasoning adds great flavor to all meats and is great for grilling. The various seasoning ingredients give a zest to chicken, pork and beef which enhances the flavor of the meat. This is a must have item !!"
123,1351123200,B000I5DJRI,A4QYIPL4Z43U2,5,Licorice for the Gluten Free,It is a very good tasting alternative to other licorice. Being Gluten Free and still getting to have a few good tasting snacks helps to stay on track.
124,1351123200,B000SATIFA,A2CXROF75RTCXB,2,Flavorless green tea,"The vacuum pack bag is great. The tea is blah. There is a hint of tea flavor. There are many whole leaves, but also quite a few small bits of leaf. I didn't find any stems in my first cup of the tea (brewed directly in the cup without a filter)."
125,1351123200,B006GA666U,A2BAYRWJ9I0LLB,5,Emerils Big Easy,"Best coffee available, I drink it on the middle setting of the five our maker has and one cups is enough."
126,1351123200,B006GA666U,AMUD7YJD0Y8D3,5,My new favourite for a nice bold morning brew,"When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!

127,1351123200,B0051ZCN9A,A3GLNZMOBLB710,5,Great for small breeds with sensitive systems,I have two small mixed breed dogs each under 10 pounds. This is to only food I have found that they can eat with out any problems.
128,1351123200,B000KY6NQG,A2EV9OYPMK4R9M,5,Crunchie,"Nowhere near as good as Violet Crumble from Aust. but a good subsitute as it's off the market.  The chocolate is good, the honeycomb, a little sweet."
129,1351123200,B000GW257S,A353PLOL85WBCV,5,Splenda French Vanilla,"Our local Wal-Mart used to carry this product, it has just a touch of flavor to your coffee without all of the calories.  Would recommend this and have to a few friends."
130,1351123200,B00412K49A,AT997T4MTH9B7,5,Love this stuff,This Green Mountain dark magic coffee is just what I was looking for. Strong enough taste to enjoy and it gets me going almost immediately. Haven't noticed any after taste and buying the 120 count it pans out to like $.61 a cup. Try it you'll like it.
131,1351123200,B001P7539A,A1582ZSGIITFP6,4,Right balance of butter and salt,"Pop Secret is one of my favorites and the Movie Theater Butter has the perfect blend of butter and salt for my tastes.  The packages I received do not expire for 6 months.  Pack of 6 is 18 bags, but in my house they should all be gone long before expiration."
132,1351123200,B0012KB3ZI,AIFGUCOUOOFJ3,5,Great for my older cat,"My older cat just stopped eating the dry kibble food a few months ago. She used to get Fancy Feast as a treat only, but now it is all she will eat. A lot of canned cat food smells repulsive! Fancy Feast actually looks & smells decent. The cat knows which cabinet I keep her food in & she sprints to the kitchen when she hears it open."
133,1351123200,B002YHU9LC,A1TWM78I835NGZ,5,"Mmmmmmm,  popcorn!",Great popcorn!  I'm a repeat buyer too.  One pack makes just a teeny bit more than my Whirly Pop can hold with the lid closed.  The kernels pop big and have a great flavor.  The hulls are farely tame for big kernels. My only suggestion for Wabash Valley Farms would be to boost the butter flavor just a smidge.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but popcorn popped on the stove top is so much better than microwaved.
134,1351123200,B002GWH92W,A343264GQDQ8Z0,5,It don't get any better for the price,"I am about half way through my first bag and looking to try a different bean. It still has the yummy oil on the beans that you only see when it is fresh or you roast your own. I like my coffee strong so I give my grinder several more grinds almost to espresso, but if you pre-wet a paper filter it works out great in a drip pot. It also causes a build up in the grinder which a tablespoon of rice fixes that. My difficulty is my own making. It has nothing to do with a superior product. I plan on staying with this company as long as Amazon handles it and am looking forward to trying all their beans to find my favorite. This is a very dark bean without almost no bitterness. You can serve this to the most discriminating guest with pride."
135,1351123200,B00954NYVY,A2S29X1UALPLSO,5,"Green Mountain kcup Black Magic, Black Diamond Extra Bold, Nantucket Blend","I have tried many of the available coffee's available but, I enjoy a robust coffee in the morning and both Black Magic and Black Diamond Extra Bold meet and exceed what I was expecting.  The Nantucket Blend is a great coffee for anytime of day or night.  I usually wait until Amazon has a sale on these to make my purchase...Make sure when you buy k cups that the Amazon Prime logo appears...Without the Amazon Prime Logo, I have found what I received in the past did not reflect what I had ordered.. Substitution get made without your knowledge and sometimes count is short, etc..."
136,1351123200,B0002I0GUY,A1AFOYZ9HSM2CZ,5,Happy with the product,My dog was suffering with itchy skin.  He had been eating Natural Choice brand (cheaper) since he was a puppy.  I was nervous to change foods.  The vet suggested to change foods sand see if the skin issues cleared up.  Wellness brand did the job.  My dog seems to love the food and the skin issues cleared up within a few weeks.
137,1351123200,B000FPJ78G,A3F14GVSJMJ0WH,2,dingos,The red part of the dingos was missing from 3 of the balls in one bag and two of them in the other. The others have not been opened yet and I found this very upsetting since this is the part the the puppies go for first. I don't mind paying that price if it is as shown. The bag show no white only balls.<br />Theresa Miller
138,1351123200,B0087ACS5A,AJZKIQO848M2P,5,Half and half Iced Tea,Have used this product for a long time and still enjoy its taste very much. Really refreshing and sometimes I add just a slice of lemon.
139,1351123200,B002TOEMWW,A23NBI33FUN8F9,1,My Chihuahuas HATE This Product,"My two Chihuahuas loved ""Cadet Gourmet Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets"", the 32-Ounce package I had been buying at Costco.  However, I discovered it was made in China and feared this product could make them sick or cause death.  So I started searching for a company in the USA that made dog jerky treats.  I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag.  This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips.  My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away.  It doesn't even smell like duck.  Rather, it smells somewhat fishy.  A waste of my money!"
140,1351123200,B003C15EUK,A32QQ3P51L0LO4,5,Always great!,"Got these for my sister who has Celiac disease and needs gluten-free.  These are one of the few candy bars she can have and<br />she LOVES them.  So glad they come in the Pops, Jr. size.  Just right!"
141,1351123200,B003Z6ZGZK,ALUMNTP7GDBS8,5,Don't underestimate this little packet,"Easy to travel with. I've used in Europe, I've used in American Wilderness. Light in wieght, strong in kick and flavor."
142,1351123200,B004Q89VXY,A14RUZEAZ9T15Q,5,The not boring black tea,"I find that most black teas are boring. Not this one. It has a fresh flavor that I love. I only drink iced black tea and I never use sugar or cream. You may love it, too."
143,1351123200,B005HVDZRM,A1QU5WEF3LS9YD,5,Twinings---a good cup of tea,I have been drinking Twining's tea for years.  It used to be made in England but now they have a plant in North Carolina for the American trade.  The tea is excellent. I drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea.
144,1351123200,B002VL66C2,A1NTG1A0WLKEOG,5,Bennicks perfect mints,"These are simply the best mints made.  I buy them when I'm in Scotland, and often have my daughter send them to me from Edinburgh.  I am so pleased to be able to purchase them through Amazon.  Please continue to have tem available."
145,1351123200,B003VCCYGW,A15NY8LOWZIUSZ,1,Small fortune spent for dead tree,"I purchased this plant after spending a small fortune hoping it would be all I hoped and read about in the description. Within the first week of purchase the plant shed all it's leaves and seems to be dead or dormant. It arrived with full beautiful leaves and a few flowers, I had high hopes. I followed the instructions to the tee and within no time it lost everything. I took it to a friend who is a professional with bonsai plants and he thinks it was sent as a dying tree meaning it comes looking great but it is really dying. I'm so angry that I spent so much and have had nothing but problems. I do have a green thumb and can usually resurrect anything but this may be a lost cause. I've tried to prune back the dead and fertilize and hope it will pull through but have a feeling I wasted $50.00. Don't waste your time hopes or money on this item. Buy local so you have support and hopefully a guarantee."
146,1351123200,B0049D7ICM,A5ZHJ9O3T5DS1,3,easy to use,Love the fragrance of this product. These bath salts smell wonderful and easy to use. A great gift idea would be to repackage this in individual containers for friends as a spa gift. Great price too.
147,1351123200,B006W6YHHI,A27DIIBWR2ASZY,5,Crack for dogs.,These thing are like crack for dogs. I am not sure of the make-up but the doggies sure love them.
148,1351123200,B003YHCN74,A16ZZXKX3U1WTQ,2,not alot of taste,"Put a cup in my rice cooker. Couldn't taste much spice -- was fairly bland. Container is small. I attached pictures. To note, Saffron is the last ingredient in the ingredients list so there's really hardly any."
149,1351123200,B0039OINN0,A1DFNY4MZG7NYO,3,buttons,They were ok but I was not impressed by them.  The cost is too high and is not worth it for this product.
150,1351123200,B005HGAV0Q,A3557OEC4JU5RS,5,Great select ion.,These were great . I loved the varity. This is the second time I have ordered these. I will order them again.
151,1351123200,B000EUIZ8K,AOHXBDUSQ62SL,1,This is not the exact one like at Starbucks,"First, this is a good tea, but it is not the exact one like at Starbucks. The one at Starbucks is different kind of teabag that has a silk like bag. It's leaves are different too. They are more fuller and these are more ground. Now I realize why the tin box (Tazo Zen Green Tea) at Starbucks could be twice as expensive as this (the tin box has 15 bags for $8.00 at Starbucks). If you want the rich experience of the Zen Green Tea, buy the tin box from Starbucks. And of course, 'You get what you Pay'!"
152,1351123200,B008O2EHNC,A1ERISG9MS2M0L,1,weak coffee if used in Hamilton single brewer,"This product can not be returned, so when the coffee turned out weak this was a real waste.  I used this in the Hamilton Beach single cup brewer."

155,1351123200,B004H4R59Y,A2YDZGGEQPLHYY,4,yummy low fat snacks,Pretty yummy for a low fat snack...crunchy and tasty with a little zing from the roasted peppers. You can also get them plain with sea salt which are also quite satisfying. Great substitute for chips and such which are just empty calories and impossible to eat only a few. I am pretty sure the lentil chips have some nutritional value as well..... and they don't taste like you are eating styrofoam like some of the rice cakes out there.
156,1351123200,B0028677GY,A597F444N325M,5,Doggie loved these,"We are very careful to feed out pooch good treats.  We look for American made.  We also want to find the right ingredients on the label.  These treats had that.  More importantly, my dog loved them.  I guess she thought she was getting 'junk food'.  But she was not.  She was getting the good stuff.  I compared the price to other treats we buy and found these very reasonable."
157,1351123200,B000O5DI3W,AL3P8NCMOOEIH,5,Pill Pockets,Our dog loves them and she is kind of a picky eater. Makes giving her medicine for her arthritis very easy.

159,1351123200,B000FBQ50I,A2XVOWD40JCFSZ,4,yummy cookies!,We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh.
160,1351123200,B001H17CJS,A7UQE24D5SB3R,5,Paws up!,We try different treats for our dogs and they seem to like the Holistic Select biscuits very much.  This has good quality ingredients just like their kibbles which our dogs like as well.
161,1351123200,B000VK08OC,A20W0ALUJMJ2F8,3,Unusual taste,"Just got this honey today and tasted it.  It has a slightly medicinal taste I don't care for.  On doing a little research, I found that the bees feed on flowers of the tree that's also called teatree, and if you have ever smelled teetree oil that's what the honey tastes like..almost a menthol taste. But since it is supposed to have such benefits health-wise, and since it was so expensive, I guess I'll go ahead and try using it..maybe to sweeten drinks or something..but for breakfast toast I'll stick to our good local honey."

It is the Neoguri Seafood & Mild Noodles and Neoguri Seafood and Spicy Noodles that are problematic, not this Shin Ramyun type by the same company Nongshim, read this article:[...]<br />ADVICE: Because of high sodium in instant noodles, put only partial seasoning package and also try not to drink the soup!"
164,1351123200,B002OFH5G6,AVV2V46YR89K,5,My favorite,"These are one of my favorite snacks.  I realize I may not be among the masses, but I find this is a great substitute for candy and the chocolate-nutty taste satisfy my sweet tooth without giving me the sugar high and subsequent crash I get from other bars.  The nuggets are the perfect size and calorie limit for a snack or quick pick-me-up."
165,1351123200,B002E0S4UW,ALJYLCIGS3QYU,5,These are Delicious!,"Great taste, right price, fabulous snack! It is the only fruit I can get my little one to eat and I can't keep my high school son out of them either. They are great pick-me-ups on the way to my daughter's soccer practice or before my early morning run. And best of all, Amazon ships these right to my door every month. No more finding the right store who carries them. I just set  up the automatic recurring shipment once and it works like a charm!"
166,1351123200,B00027UVL4,A8NAPMCV0PV8F,5,"Wow, what a smooth espresso !","My wife and I have always purchased Starbucks espresso, but our usual supplier ran out which gave me time to research other brands.<br />After doing some internet recon, we found that lavAzza is Italy's #1 chosen brand, so we figured it was worth 20.00 to try something new and we are glad we did, it was much smoother and all while producing more froth at the top of our mocha's.<br />We highly recommend this product, I know we will be purchasing it in the future, but only in the 150 pod size bringing down the cost-per-pod or (cpp) as we call it down from .50 per pod in the 40 count box to .30 per pod.<br /><br />WOW smoother and creamier espresso at less cost than our OLD staple brand..."

I am a decafinated coffee drinker most of the time but my wife likes a little kick to start her morning and the Half-Caf does the trick, and Green Mountain's Half-Caf has a very good taste without the decalf after taste.

He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles."

One thing though, it is better to refrigerate the buns and microwave a few seconds to warm it and not do the usual bbq or toast warming. I have found that microwaving makes reguar bread rubbery but not so the low carb buns (same for their hot dog buns) while the usual warming makes them dry. The ingredients are different and so the warming needed is different. Done this way they do not come out dry and cardboardy. and using more condiments helps also. So I give them a high rating even though the shipping makes them expensive and thus it is worth it for our health."

A few hours later, we were shocked at the dog spitting up everything in this stomach- he threw up about 3 times, and then continued to spit up mucous and bile fluid. Gross, and really unfortunate :(<br /><br />I contacted both fruitables and amazon, who both graciously accepted the open bags as returns, and fruitables checked the lot numbers of the bags I had. I guess my dog had a particular sensitivity to something in these, which stinks because I really wanted him to love these nice smelling treats.<br /><br />Hopefully others have better luck with them!"
198,1351123200,B0076YVPLG,A1APK6FWZC13B,4,Perfect for a quick lunch!,"I was impressed with this meal, I couldn't imagine the quality Barilla is known for being seriously ready for consumption in sixty seconds. What I love most about it was the fact that it had real sauce that is comperable to what you would put on your homemade pasta. Most meals like this taste more like an upgraded cup of noodles, where this is a nice meal in a crunch. Now I will say you really need to read the instructions before cooking. The opening instructions can be assumed and cause the sauce to go flying when the food is done cooking. With that in mind, it's not ideal for kids to cook on their own. The film was rather tight and I can see a child or pre-teen getting burned if they are not paying attention while the open the contents. With that, please be careful. Outside of that, it was delicious for a microwave meal."

That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful."

At first, I was less than thrilled, because for almost a month my cat's stools smelled more foul than I could stand. I was ready to finish the bag and then switch her back to her old food, despite the fact that her old food contained less healthy ingredients, but I am so happy I decided to wait it out because once her little system got used to the change (or maybe detoxed), she is a different cat!!!<br /><br />I have had my cat for 9 years, and she has always been a bit grouchy. I chalked it up to her personality and never thought twice. However, since changing her food, her personality has greatly changed! She is so much happier and more content, much more loving. She is a much happier little feline!<br /><br />So, I am now a happy customer. I would recommend this cat to anyone, it is so much healthier than most other cat foods out there.

204,1351123200,B001ELJJZG,A24AIWQ5TEVQGU,5,This is a big container.,"October 25th, 2012<br /><br />This is my 4th wine kit in 60 days and my second which I sourced from Amazon. As wine & beer making have several steps over time I will update this review as I proceed through all the steps. This is a very heavy container.  Getting that bag empty will be the trickiest part of the wine kit I think. I was simply not strong enough to pick up the bag of 'must' from the bucket shipping container. What I did was to dump the contents of the shipping bucket into my plastic food grade fermentation vessel.<br /><br />Because I couldn't lift the bag out of the primary I had to cut a hole in the bag as near to the bottom as possible and lift the bag out of the primary as the bag drained.  This was still a tricky procedure as the 'must' initially just pooled on top of the 23 liter bag of must.  I think next time I try one of these 55 lbs kits I am going to borrow my step-son who works unloading UPS trucks everyday and is strong as a horse to hold the bag of must clear of the 'primary' while I open the bag the proper way and let it drain into the primary.<br /><br />I have at the time of this writing transferred the juice/must to my plastic primary fermentation vessel, added the bentonite, stirred, added the yeast, and stirred again.  I don't take the specific gravity as I like my wines very dry and so I just let them ferment out completely.  I do like that the kit includes corks (one less thing to purchase)."

The Vogue product is the best of the ones I have tried.  I do also keep a supply of the home made stock when I cook poultry, but I don't bother so much with that anymore because this product is such a good substitute.  In addition to using it for the most obvious chicken-flavored dishes, I frequently add a teaspoon to various sauces and gravies -- just enough to add some depth to the mixture, but not enough to make it taste like chicken soup."

So my Hat's off to you for your diligence and care; Thank you.<br /><br />I tried the hard candy, sour fruits, licorice, and lemon but was disappointed...I guess my sweet tooth craves something a bit sweeter!

Instead, if you are looking for a rich taste, aroma, and crema, I can recommend this coffee very highly. If brewed right, this coffee will have very rich undertones, without bitterness, and with a hint of chocolate. I have tried Illy as well, and while do I like the Illy, I prefer this Lavazza variety (the Illy is also more expensive). For those who haven't tried the Lavazza yet, I suspect that quite a few among you might like it, especially if Starbucks' taste is too harsh for you."

217,1351123200,B000SDKDM4,A2LJZOZHTOKBOB,5,Delicious,"While there may be better coffee beans available, this is my first purchase and my first time grinding my own beans.  I read several reviews before purchasing this brand, and am extremely pleased with the way the coffee tastes.  Sooooo much better than Starbucks.  I can't believe the difference!  However, I should have purchased a smaller quantity since it is taking me quite a while to use up a 2 pound bag.  I understand that coffee should be used up fairly soon after the bag has been opened."
218,1351123200,B001NI7OGG,A26HIQ5LWV4SBF,5,Amazing stuff!,"This sauces are absolutely great! First of all, unlike many others, they are not just plain hot, they are actually really, really tasty.<br /><br />I'm an average heat lover. That means I don't count drops when adding Tabasco to my meal, but not eating whole habaneros instead of cucumbers either :)<br />So here's my humble opinion about this combo:<br /><br />1) Jalapeno Death. Jalapenos, tomatillos and tequila. Very mild, crispy and refreshing. Amazing on tamales. Expect to finish this bottle fast.<br /><br />2) Original Death - delicious, frutty and moderately spicy. If you felt like original Tabasco is not hot enough, this one will be just right. Good with pretty much everything. I did not try it on oysters yet, but expecting this to be superb combination.<br /><br />3) After Death. That's where the fun begins! Nice punch of habanero and long peppery aftertaste. Great on red meat, absolutely gorgeous on lamb and pork.  My favorite so far.<br /><br />4) Sudden Death. Did you read the recommendation on the bottle about using a micro-drop? Oh, you didn't... Well, you probably should. This thing is HOT. But it feels interesting: not an instant kick, but rather fast growing powerful avalanche of heat with long earthy aftertaste. It will put tears on your eyes and smile on your face - that's for sure. And because there's no instant kick, it is really easy to overdose, so be careful.<br />This sauce also has Siberian ginseng in it (not sure if it affects taste, but just having it in sauce is cool indeed)<br /><br />P.S. I'm looking forward to trying out Mega and Ultra Death<br /><br />P.P.S.  With this combo you also get two very nice and surprisingly well made skull keychains."

I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides ""Oh you want ALL of it!"" and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better."

The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough.

227,1351123200,B001D0IZBM,AMUD7YJD0Y8D3,5,My new favourite for a nice bold morning brew,"When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU"">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4"">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's ""Big Easy Bold"").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed."
228,1351123200,B003OPCL5U,A323AEDVZ84ZFT,4,"Not a pumpkin-y as I would have hoped, but a great flavour","I bought this coffee seeking fall flavors, but unfortunately, it just seemed there wasn't enough in this coffee! BUT the price for the amount of coffee you get is unbeatable and the flavor it still wonderful, just not as pumpkin-y as I would have hoped. Plus, it's organic and all that good stuff."

I'm very passionate about tea. I've never had it hot but I'm sure it's delicious that way as well.
231,1351123200,B00469R3WE,A1OUCH9GD6J0D5,3,Great Cereal Ridiculous Price,"So I've been looking for this cereal literally every time I go to the store ever since I had it at boot camp 5 months ago. I went to about 4 to 5 different stores all with no success, also none of the store associates from any of the stores knew what I was talking about. Least to say, I was extremely happy to see that I could order my dream cereal on here. The product description does say that its 50 oz. however, for some reason I thought I would receive a much bigger bag for the price of $17.47. The cereal, like I remember it, is very good and my boyfriend agrees that it is the best cereal he has ever had, but sadly after 5 months of searching I wont be ordering this cereal again. The price is way too steep and its simply not worth the price. I will wait for the price to fall before ordering."

I don't know if it gives more energy because how does one measure that?  But, blueberries and pomegranate have been proven to be very healthy fruits and the low calorie count is an added plus.  I will be going to my local supermarket to get more of this new drink instead of my usual juice."
233,1351123200,B006V5X8NO,AR6CLLQC3ZO8N,4,Good quality grinder,"I had become almost addicted to the garlic and sea salt grinder that the Dollar Tree used to sell. Of course, (as is the case with almost everything they sell that I really like) they quit carrying it, and that led me on a search for a replacement product. The Olde Thompson is very good, and I would purchase it again; however, I wish it had more garlic and less salt in the mixture. It isn't possible to add dried garlic flakes to the grinder because the top is not removable. (At least I couldn't figure out how to get it off.) The vendor's service was outstanding."
234,1351123200,B008JA7CRW,A4BNJSZVARL5W,5,Yum!,"I loved the V8 Pomegranate Blueberry energy drink! It was very good and has some of the fruits and veggies that we try to pack in all day. This is also an easy way to get the nutrition that most people are lacking. When you have a busy day, it's hard to get everything in and with the V8 Pomegranate Blueberry energy drink, it's so easy, you don't even have to think about it!"

It says energy buy its no added caffeine or sugar just natural fruit juice for a little boost. I love pomegranate and the blueberry adds just the right amount of sweetness. Not too tart not too sweet - well balanced. Nice change up and if you like Pom/blueberry :).  I bought a 64 ounce afterward because I did enjoy it.
237,1351123200,B006Q7YFLQ,A7EU2BWLLCJY2,5,My dogs love them!,"I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies."

It's not a K-Cup. So my guess is that they don't pay royalties to Keurig. And they pass the savings along to you.<br /><br />So if it's not a K-cup, what is it? Too hard to explain. It's like a cross between a tea-bag and a K-Cup.<br /><br />Here's all that matters: it fits in your Keurig machine--no problem. They package it in a way that it stays fresh. And it brews as good of a cup of coffee as any K-Cup.<br /><br />But it's WAY cheaper.<br /><br />Try it. You'll love it!"

When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.

247,1351123200,B001PS5TMU,A398R5RS3RE8EO,3,"It was okay, but didn't really help","I bought this dog food after the ""Tainted Dog Food"" incident this year.  I did some research to look for an alternative for my sensitive and allergic labracollie, and liked that Addiction used free-range animals and seemed to use natural ingredients.  My dog loved the taste and dug right into it.<br /><br />I had her on this diet for almost two weeks.  I bought two bags at a local mom and pop pet store, but it did not particularly improve her stool--which is a big factor for me and her digestive health.  Her stool was still softer than normal.  Another issue I found was that the Venison meal was very high in protein.  My dog is nine years-old and not as active as before, so I wasn't very fond of the protein content.  This dog food may be better-suited for active or younger dogs.<br /><br />At my local pet store, they also have Lamb, La Porchetta, Salmon Bleu, and a couple other puppy variations.  I bought Lamb and Porchetta as well.  Among the three my dog ate, she seemed to like the Venison the best.  I knew this because she always hesitated with the Lamb and Porchetta.  I have not tried the Kangaroo (which is available on Amazon), but I may buy a bag just so I can know how it is for future reference, and I can offer a review.<br /><br />As for the price, yes, it's a little on the higher side.  At $17.00 for a four-pound bag, I would try it for a couple weeks and make sure your dog does well (enough) on it before investing in a regular diet regimen of this dog food.  For me, though, the results I received did not justify me having to spend the extra money for this dog food, even though my dog actually liked eating it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Apparently it tastes very good.<br />2. Good ingredients.<br />3. High protein content (good).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Pricey.<br />2. High protein content (bad)."

These things were born to be in a Manhattan!  Also recommend skipping the vermouth and adding the Italian liquor Amaro.  That and these cherries will change your Manhattan experience forever"

The Senseo pods became impossible to find locally, so I looked online.  I drink decaf coffee, and it's often difficult to find decaf in different variaties.  When I found these pods from Baronet, I decided to take a chance on them.  They are so much better than the ones from Senseo!  The flavor is rich and the price is quite a bit less than the old pods I was buying. The Baronet pods are also stronger in flavor, which is great if you want to make a larger mug of coffee.  They come in flavors, too!  Highly recommend!!"

I'd buy a terrine or use a loaf pan and make it myself rather than pay these kinds of prices.  There's a whole classic text on making terrines and pates at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080942925X"">Terrines, Pates & Galantines (The Good Cook Techniques & Recipes Series)</a> and you can watch Julia Child do it on The French Chef.

I cooked grilled chicken breasts, beef cooked every way, even lean pork chops...no deal...It is very grueling to watch your only baby starving!!! I tried 32 flavors of dog food. He has always preferred dry food over canned food. So I was perusing the dog food offered by my ""hero sight"" Amazon,and something about Halo Spots Stew caught my attention. For days I went back and forth between flavors that my pooch would find appealing. Finally, I settled on the adult lamb recipe. After ordering I thought ""Oh no, the kibble is going to be too large for his small mouth""( Am I neurotic, doting mother or what?) Anyone who thinks I am totally disgusting doesn't know what this situation is like!! I was prepared to chop the dog food in my food processor...BUT, the food arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and what a surprise!!! Upon opening the bag of food, to my pleasant surprise, the smell of the food was so good..so fresh.. and the kibble is so small!! Now for the happy ending...Celli ate every bit in his bowl as if to say ""This is what I've been waiting for""...Mommy will rest tonight...Thanks Halo and Amazon...My love and gratitude to you!!!"

Although he enjoys all of the Nylabone flavors, he goes through them in record time because he's a chronic chewer.  Considering how much it costs,I decided it wasn't worth it.  Instead, I now buy Purina Chewnola bones - they entertain my little guy for hours and he keeps going back to it until it's gone.  I recommend this to anyone with a dog who's into chewing.  I also recommend you buy them on Amazon since you can pay as much as 50% less than you pay at a store.  (The 3 stars is because the cost doesn't match the lasting power.)"

A few hours later, we were shocked at the dog spitting up everything in this stomach- he threw up about 3 times, and then continued to spit up mucous and bile fluid. Gross, and really unfortunate :(<br /><br />I contacted both fruitables and amazon, who both graciously accepted the open bags as returns, and fruitables checked the lot numbers of the bags I had. I guess my dog had a particular sensitivity to something in these, which stinks because I really wanted him to love these nice smelling treats.<br /><br />Hopefully others have better luck with them!"

But the Amazon price is beyond comprehension, $18.88 when compared to in-store price of $7.49 and on top of that, and for reasons that are totally uncler, the store is marking it down by an additional $3.50 so that the price came out to be $3.99.  And to anticipate a quesiton, I checked the ""expiration"" date and it is off until late 2013.  Even if there was no discout, the $7.49 regular price is a bargain, at least compared to Amazon.  And this is good olive oil, the olives are grown and harvested in California with processing on site."

Too pricey but cute item!"

The Imagine Organic is just tomato soup, no other BS in it. It is the best tasting too.

That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful."

They are a decent chocolate, similar to Cadbury milk chocolate bars you can get in the US, but they have an interesting flaky texture. I think they are a bit sweeter than regular Cadbury milk chocolate bars(but those are already pretty sweet too, so am not sure), and even though I like the texture, it's not worth it to pay so much for them. I suggest if you're craving Cadbury chocolate just stick with the kinds you can get in the US, it saves you money and hassle."
301,1351123200,B007FK3HHG,A38XTOID4VG01S,3,Alleged benefits,"I was somewhat surprised to discover that--among aloe's many reputed benefits were digestive, immune, and skin health advantages. Of course, these claims could be simple marketing ploys, but this Aloe Gloe Natural Aloe Water is certainly worth a try. It did strike me as somewhat curious that the water contains both ""certified organic cane sugar"" AND ""certified organic stevia."" I'm left to wonder why water requires any sweetening at all, let alone the addition of two separate sweeteners. At any rate, I drank just one bottle (approximately 35  calories; 10 grams of carbohydrates), and I suspect that's not nearly enough to reap the benefits of this product. I'm a bit skeptical, but I'd be curious to find out whether anyone who drinks this regularly notices any actual benefits."

Lately, I've been swept up in the craze of coconut water.  When I saw this bottle of 'aloe water' I immediately wondered what the new flavor was.<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I was reminded of the smell of apple juice.  Aloe Gloe has a very sweet, crisp flavor.  Considering there is a both cane sugar AND Stevia sweetening up this drink, I guess that isn't a surprise.  It's very pleasant and enjoyable, and would be extremely refreshing chilled and served on a hot summer's day.<br /><br />One odd note, though: if you drink directly from the bottle, there's a distinctive plastic  note to the liquid.  That was rather disconcerting.  I think that if you drink it from a glass this would probably be alleviated."
303,1351123200,B008ADQOJA,A1YYFX661KECLP,5,Incredible matcha!,This matcha is incredible - I got hooked on plain matcha - so having someone kick it up a notch and add this incredible flavour is amazing.  I'm a big Boston Cream donut fan and this has the same taste too it.  Highly recommend it!

It's an excellent butter to use on fancy Eurostyle bread with organic milk on mornings.  But it's not a 'cooking' butter, yes one can use lurpak for cooking, but it's really a waste of flavor and such premium price to boot.<br /><br />Eventually I found another premium butter that replaced lurpak, Plugra, made in USA, and cheaper than lurpak, and even more complex and nuanced flavor than lurpak.<br /><br />Even Cook's illustrated declared Plugra a superior butter than lurpak, its former favorite just like it used to be mine."
305,1351123200,B007FK3HHG,A3RYSRBRTZB0JD,5,Wow! Clean and fresh tasting,"I was curious as to how this would taste - and I have to say they did a great job.  It taste clean and is refreshing, to top it off its also very good for me to drink.  I love natural products and this one fits into my narrow box of acceptability and it's taste was a pleasant surprise.<br />Jesus' Blessings and Peace"
306,1351123200,B007FK3HHG,ALI483EPAZ6YH,4,Almost Perfect!,"I wanted this to be perfect...as a result of years searching for an Organic Aloe Drink that was not too thick, gloppy, and more like a medicine than a satisfying, good-for-you refresher with all the benefits to digestion and the immune system. Aloe Gloe - almost made it - a silky smooth consistency of a 35 calorie serving per container, made in California USA (Yay!), delicious alone or with food, easily digestible and tastes like the good-stuff-Aloe. But why is organic cane juice (pure sugar), and Stevia (a natural sugar sweetener) added as well to equal 4 grams of sugar? For purists admittedly, the latter can make digestion more difficult and possibly compromise the immune system as well. The taste therefore in my opinion has an over-the-top sweetness note. But if you tend to drink sweet stuff, and/or like it that way, you will probably love the product, and be far better off drinking something actually good-for-you than some carbonated, diluted, and/or chemical concoction of who-knows-what. The product is Gluten Free, has no preservatives, is certified organic Aloe along with organic water as the primary ingredients. And...to underscore, it is made in the good ole USA! Thanks!"

The amount of salt seems to have been gradually reduced from the levels it used to have many years ago. I would prefer a bit more salt myself - but cannot find a better alternative."
310,1351123200,B00823T1K2,A1X2LENOF84LCQ,4,Good product,"I like that this is a better product for my pets but really for the price of it I couldn't afford to buy this all the time. My cat isn't very picky usually and she ate this, we usually buy her the friskies prime filets, the vet said it is better to not change their diet and buy different types of food and flavors all the time so we normally stick with the chicken. I am glad this is a chicken formula since that is what she is used to. If it weren't so expensive I would buy it all the time but I do have to budget. I take good care of my animals but I have to watch the cost so that the humans can eat and pay bills. I am trying to get a baby kitten to start on solid foods and I am trying with this since it is quality and it is easier for him to try and eat than the filets.<br />It is a good quality cat food but it loses one star for being more than I can afford to buy on a constant basis and the cans are very small so it would take more cans to feed a cat."

When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.

One sachet will give a great taste to 1 litre (approximately a 32 oz nalgene sized container) for only 70 calories.  I SO appreciate the fact that there are no artificial sweeteners in this - I'm much happier with just the very small amount of sugar, agave and fruit juice which are present here, instead of the acesulfame, aspartame etc which you get in other products.  Tastes great, contains no nasties and hardly any extra calories.  Awesome."

Compared to Stevita, the Better Stevia packets don't dissolve in cold drinks easily.  With Stevita, I can simply swirl the glass with a little water and get the packet contents to completely dissolve; with this product, I had to use a spoon to stir vigorously and it still left 'clumps'.  Maybe it works better in warm beverages but it's a pain in cold drinks."

The Cadbury eggs and dairy milk bars are the best, but still quite sweet.

We never knew about fresh frozen food, we are delighted to find Yummy Spoonfuls, I actually never thought I could find baby food without ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid added nor that it can actually be made fresh like you would at home, OMG, this is how food should taste, the peas, sweet potato, apple and squash all taste nothing like baby food.

I wanted to see what the 2 oz. size looked like to get an idea before purchasing but couldn't find a close match in our spice cupboard so I pulled the trigger. UGH! At the store today and I see the 2 oz. is the tiny one and about $2.50!! A rip off as each is about $5.00 here!"

The kernels pop big and have a great flavor.  The hulls are farely tame for big kernels. My only suggestion for Wabash Valley Farms would be to boost the butter flavor just a smidge.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but popcorn popped on the stove top is so much better than microwaved.

I have been looking for something I can add to my dog's food to give her a bit of variation, that won't make her tummy sick.  This was the perfect solution.  You can actually see what is inside and the ingredients are mostly very natural.<br /><br />At first I rehydrated the food with some water and added kibble on top.  This worked out great and it was so much easier than taking wet food out of a can.  I suppose if you aren't too concerned with financial costs, and your dog is doing well on this food, keep going.  But 6 pounds of food for $20.00 is not going to work for me.<br /><br />I realize that the directions say you should add water but the owner of the local pet store that I purchased this from suggested to sprinkle a small amount on top of kibble, just dry.  I did this and my dog liked it.  At one point she would just lick up the dehydrated bits; and slowly eat the kibble.  I mix the dehydrated parts with the kibble now.  This made the dehydrated food last much longer than.  A box lasts a few months now, and my dog enjoys eating her meals.<br /><br />So far I have tried the Herbed Lamb and Beef Zucchini.  My dog seems to like each one equally.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good for sensitive/allergic dogs.<br />2. Can use de/rehydrated.<br />3. Apparently it tastes very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.

The six 6.25oz bags we received from Amazon were SMASHED so they were POP CRUMBS! Amazon did nothing about it. Do NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! Buy POP CHIPS from your local store.

337,1351123200,B006E0RJ0O,AT8N386G0DVS3,4,Delicate flavour and smell,"Delightfully fragrant after infusing in hot water. Delicate taste -- somewhat sweet and fruity, but the hint of ginger lingers (pleasantly) after the cup of tea is consumed.<br /><br />I first tried this particular flavour in a Tea Forte sampler gift, and I'm glad I got the loose leaf tea in this form. I won't say that this is great value for 50 servings, but the uniqueness of this blend redeems this purchase."
338,1351123200,B003L7JO9C,A1EDO00W3VH2X5,5,Great tasting,"This is awesome salt. I buy it over and over as I just love the maltiness flavor. If you are a fan of salt and vinegar, then this is the salt for you."
339,1351123200,B005Y10XZ2,A11F5KW6QXHL8L,5,Yummy,These chocolate protein bars taste just like brownies. They are absolutely delicious. I was very surprised to find the South Beach Diet bars did not taste like a diet bar but instead something homemade. I recommend them highly.

The product itself is fine in the other cans, and I am using the rest.  My cats really like this food and I have ordered it before with no smashed cans.  I hope the company is not foisting old product on online shoppers."

344,1351123200,B004ECMDXW,A3FLNCYFL7465Q,5,Very tasty and good for you!,"I have always loved this product and was glad to subscribe so that I could have a constant supply on hand.  The smoky flavor and the lower salt content are very tasty.  The supplier keeps juggling the price and sometimes it's not available; I suspect we consumers are eating these poor fish faster than they can propagate. I'm very glad Amazon makes these available, buying them locally can be very expensive by comparison."
345,1351123200,B0044AAGNI,A3TRJP82AD6LXF,1,Okay if you like cinnamon candy.,"Just not the normal flavors I am used to getting. The red ones are hot and spicy like the cinnamon candies. So if you like those and like gum this would be perfect for you. The pink, orange, and yellow dont have a great flavor. I really like the green ones."

My dog absolutely loves this food, but of course all dogs love any kind of food lol My rottie's coat is very smooth and shiny. This is exactly what Eukanuba advertised so I'm very pleased with the results.<br /><br />Thank you amazon for the expedient service!"
347,1351123200,B005MHRB7G,A1KES0BS9W83OF,4,Great Item,"This is my go to choice for premade baby food. I love the packaging, making it easy to throw in the diaper bag and pull out whenever needed. I like the ingredients a lot more than similar products. It is just the pureed vegetables and some lemon juice to keep it from spoiling. My kids love it and it is always a treat when we are out and I can grab one. It took them a little while to figure out how to suck it out and I normally have to push up the last of it for the one year olds. Great product, would recommend it."
348,1351123200,B000KLTM4O,A20CUART3ZQDP9,5,Sweet Perfection,"Not everything in this world is perfect, but this really is the perfect candy. Is delicious!!! I cannot have enough of it!"

350,1351123200,B0018NLL2Y,A3FW29GQ2BNLHI,3,Unusual,"Cute packaging. Fun for kids. The flavor is way more ""mint"" than banana. In fact, you can barely taste the banana at all if you're expecting banana-flavored candies. It's an unusual flavor combination, at best."
351,1351123200,B001FVLLGK,A2KG2ME7DZQ7L4,5,Fenugreek Aids in Breast Milk Production,"Daughter is breastfeeding but felt she wasn't producing enough milk. We decided to incorporate Fenugreek into her diet via various ways. Since she is a sprout lover, I agreed to grow these organic sprouts for her. I used about a tablespoon or so initially and was elated how well the seeds sprouted. There were very few seeds that didn't take. I did prewash and soak overnight in a hot rinse bath because the seeds are harder than some. What an incredible aroma from these sprouts. After 5 days in the mini Sprout Master, they crisped up in the fridge and are now a healthy addiction to daughter's diet. Fenugreek is known to help increase milk production and these seeds can also be ground and added to many Indian or African dishes for an unusual almost maple syrup taste. Very worth the extra time to sprout our own seeds without a fear of salmonella as many sprouts have been contaminated in the grocery stores. Always buy organic sprouting seeds."

354,1351123200,B000YOQOAC,A17XLNVNQ8GIQE,5,Superb Flavor and Great Price,"Golden Barrel Blackstrap Molasses was all that I anticipated and expected.  I was inspired and encouraged by memories of my father adding it to my oatmeal when I was a child. I was not disappointed!  I still like oatmeal as my Dad made it with raisins, some pecan chunks and a tablespoon of molasses.  No white sugar is needed...it is pretty sweet! I sometimes add almond milk, but not always!  Golden Barrel Blackstrap Molasses is also great in molasses cookies and Ginger Snaps!  You just have to try it to be consumed by the joy jumping on your tongue!  Thank you Golden Barrel!!"
355,1351123200,B003D4F1QS,AWZZUM4YPP3H9,5,I couldn't love the double bergamot more,I'm absolutely addicted to this tea. it's the best tea I've ever had. when Starbucks changed their black iced tea I had to find a replacement. this stuff is better than anything ever. I'm very passionate about tea. I've never had it hot but I'm sure it's delicious that way as well.
356,1351123200,B003M678R2,A2TLHWZKNDRJY0,5,Nothing but the Best Fir My Cat,"This is the greatest food I have ever found for my cat. He's old and not in the best of health, but since I switched him to this diet he has had an incredible change in his health. His diabetes has reversed  itself, and his kidney functions have become normal again. He will continue to live many more healthier years. And, he loves the food!"
357,1351123200,B004BKVQF8,AG4YGLLIE8BWP,5,Makes me drool just thinking of them,"The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions...<br />Get them while you can...  Their other flavors are great tooo"

The pieces are really tiny but you can tell that it is made from quality ingredients (it also smells really bad), but my dog loves it. I highly recommend this product as it is a quality product that is actually healthy for your pup!"
359,1351123200,B0015AWU7U,A11XAIFA10G7TS,5,Wonderful!,"I was standing in a hallway at my daughter's high school when one of the other parents handed me this sucker.  I loved it!  Within a couple of days, I went to the grocery store to buy a bag and they were out.  Drove to another grocery store and they were out.  Came home and ordered from Amazon (which I should have done from the beginning).<br /><br />These are basically melted Apple Jolly Ranchers coated in caramel.  Each one is oddly shaped due to the ingredients so they look a bit odd, but who cares when they taste this good?  The sweet and the tart mix together well for a wonderful flavor.  I also like them since they take a while to consume and when I am finished, I feel like I have satisfied my craving for sweets.<br /><br />I keep a couple in my purse now and have found myself handing them out to friends.  Most of whom have the same reaction I do --- great!"

361,1351123200,B000SARJQK,A2UWLIFD3VBKPS,5,got what I expected,"This is a black tea with french vanilla essence, so obviously it's not going to taste like most vanilla people are used to. Black tea has a strong flavor so the vanilla doesn't stand out as much and also natural unsweetened vanilla tastes a lot different than commercial vanilla products or artificial vanilla.<br /><br />I'm guessing a lot of people are used to artificial vanilla since it's a lot sweeter. The difference between real vanilla and artificial vanilla is like the difference between a watermelon and watermelon flavor.<br /><br />I do have one complaint though, the tea leaves smell like maple syrup and vanilla. Kind of weird, but it tastes good."
362,1351123200,B0045GX66A,AW4AH10OLSV5I,5,Delicious!,"I haven't had Orange Blossom Honey this good since we moved from Florida to Texas many years ago.  It brought back amazing memories and a very happy mouth.  If you are a honey lover and want the best tasting honey ever, you have to order a couple of bottles.  They were shipped timely, packaged very well (in a plastic bag besides the packing material) reasonably priced, and worth ordering.  This was my first order of Tropic Bee and it definitely won't be my last."
363,1351123200,B002IEVJRY,A2Q89DEW2Y91A7,4,Nice but very sweet,"I really enjoyed this iced coffee drink, but it is very sweet. I usually drink a shot of espresso over ice in a 12 ounce glass then filled the rest of way with skimmed milk, with 2 packs of sugar. This tasted like my homemade version but was much sweeter. The coffee flavor was good - tasted very fresh-brewed despite coming out of a can. Just sweet. Candy bar sweet."
364,1351123200,B002IEVJRY,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,2,I did not like it.,"I did not like the taste of this Illy cappuccino drink.  I like coffee and coffee drinks in general, and I was looking forward to trying something new, but this product had a slight metallic/chemical aftertaste that, while not strong, was present in sufficient strength to make it less than pleasing to me.  I much prefer the Starbucks Mocha Cappuccino drink that tastes only of coffee, milk, sugar and chocolate.  I do not know if it is the metal container that imparts the aftertaste to the Illy product.  The similar Starbucks drink comes in a glass container that I suppose could have something to do with its fresher taste.  Also, since my opinion is certainly subjective, others may like the Illy drink and be just as justified in their opinion."
365,1351123200,B004TEVING,A26CJA8EMEJW6W,5,Great Salt Substitute,"My wife and I use this as a low sodium alternative to regular table salt.  We cook with it and we sprinkle it on food on the plate.  Either way, it tastes absolutely the same as standard salt....still with the iodide we want but with 66% less sodium, according to the label. We certainly recommend it."

367,1351123200,B004BKVQF8,AWFA8N9IXELVH,1,Deceptive description,On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.
368,1351123200,B0081XPTBS,A1KG2FZQW58S2F,4,"It's not Mother's milk, but it's great formula!","After going back to work full-time, I really struggled with keeping up with nursing my baby full-time. I just could not meet the quota that baby wanted to consume through pumping, no matter how often I pumped, what supplements I took, what diet I had, etc. I started using the Enfamil samples they sent me in the mail before I had my baby. First of all, I was kinda disgusted with how yucky it smelled. Baby didn't seem to like it either and spit up most of it after drinking it. We went to try their formula for babies who are gassy and as I was waiting for it to warm up I read the ingredient label and was shocked to see that the very first ingredient was corn syrup solids. Really??? In infant formula? I know it needs to contain sugar but come on!<br />So that started me on a research binge and I found that all formulas have to have some sort of sugar in them, but the kind of sugar is what matters. Moms make lactose and glucose (although in smaller amounts than lactose) and there is also fructose and sucrose. Fructose is what they make from corn (AKA HFCS), and sucrose is what they use in artificial sweeteners. I voted primarily for lactose and glucose, but found that a lot of formulas focused on fructose and sucrose, and if they had glucose it was from brown rice (this was during the scare that rice had arsenic in it).<br />FINALLY I found Earth's Best. I was impressed that not only did it have lactose and glucose but glucose was the 4TH ingredient instead of the first or second. This was the most important point to me in purchasing, but even more important -was baby going to like it? When I mixed it the first time it didn't have a sour odor to it, and it smelled like milk (granted, as all formula, it smells after it sits for a while). It even looked like milk (hooray) AND baby gobbled it right up. ALL OF IT. She loves the stuff! Best part is there are no problems with transitioning from breast to bottle, so now she is supplemented with the formula after her fill of breast-milk when I'm home. She even gets excited to drink it!<br />I think there's something everyone needs to keep in mind. We don't live in a `clean' society any more. Everything has toxins and chemicals, you have to choose the lesser of two evils. Everything is bad in excess: sunshine can give you cancer, tap water can give you cavities and diseases and raw fruits and veggies can give you pesticides. Even air is bad for you, depending on where you live. So I say, do the best with what you have and don't let yourself get too carried away with all the hype about harmful stuff. In the end, I feel I made the right choice for my baby and chose the next best thing to breast-milk that I could find that was relatively affordable and easy to obtain."

Company certifies gluten free and kosher, it would be really nice if that information were available on Amazon, but it's not.  I got it from the company.  I believe they also are made in a facility that doesn't process nuts, but you'd have to check that on the company web site.  Search for the company website for allergen info."

Most most of them have been rather ho-hum.  Something I drink to feel better but not necessarily tasty.<br /><br />This one stands apart, and is pleasant to drink.  With the colder weather coming I suspect I will be enjoying it more.<br /><br />This green tea also stands up fine to a bit of ice to drink cold, not something I can say about any of the other green teas I have tried, mostly because I wouldn't have even considered it with them.

Most times she won't have time to eat a full meal and these are such a great alternative to fast food.  I will order again & this time I'll get a few for moi! Really loved the cranberry too..
395,1351123200,B008JKU2CO,A34XBAIFT02B60,1,Should advertise coconut as an ingredient more prominently,"First, these should be called Mac - Coconut bars, as Coconut is the #2 ingredient and Mango is #3.  Second, lots of people don't like coconut.  I happen to be allergic to it.  Word to Amazon that if you want happy customers to make things like this more prominent.  Thanks."

398,1351123200,B0034EDLS2,A1Z42SO1EE4L02,5,Great Taste,I love the KIND bars.  They taste great and are much healthier than other bars.  Also they satisfy your taste for something sweet so are healthier than eating candy.
399,1351123200,B001EO5U3I,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,5,There Is No Better Oatmeal Around,"I'm biased, I'm Irish and overall I think everything is better if it comes from Ireland.  This includes whiskey, beer and now oatmeal!  The oatmeal, of course, is the healthiest of the three!  I know that Oprah has recommended steel cut oats for their health benefits, and while I'm not big into listening to Oprah it appears she's right on target here.  I started eating these right after a cholesterol test, the doctor wanted to put me on medication and I asked if I could come back and take another test in two weeks.  I changed my diet to include Irish oats for breakfast every morning and in two weeks the doctor said ""hey, whatever you're doing just keep it up"" as the numbers were much better.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there's nothing that is a miracle here, but they are definitely a healthy choice for breakfast that will leave you better off than sugar filled cereals or bacon and eggs.  The oatmeal's taste is fairly bland, as you'd expect from oatmeal so I like to make mine with cinnamon and raisins or with either a little honey or sweetner added.<br /><br />Amazon has always been a better price than any of our normal grocery stores so it's a great place to get them if you're local club store doesn't carry it!"

402,1351123200,B0007U5J40,A194RHTL3MSZ3O,3,Very sweet,"I like the crunchy-ness of the middle, but it doesn't have a great flavor, basically just a very sweet taste without much substance. The chocolate around it is pretty sweet too. If you like really sweet candy and crunchy-ness then go ahead and get them, but there are much better chocolates out there."
403,1351123200,B0039KEQTO,A2C7MXJF5OOSBS,5,"Great product, but too much of it.",This pearls were exactly what I was looking for and made delicious tapioca pudding. My only complaint is that you have to order so many boxes. What am I going to do with all that tapioca?? Two or three would've lasted me a long time.

405,1351123200,B007HP6TVU,A20NYQ6WARUXPQ,4,Caramel Matcha-yum!,"This matcha is smooth and creamy-and smells divine. The best part is that red leaf matcha is of high quality, so you never get the grainy stuff at the bottom as I have with other matchas. Try with just a splash of soy milk for a real treat!"
406,1351123200,B0064A8DXG,A3CM9FBBOL2WWB,4,Does What you expect!,"These refillable k-cups are a bit pricey, but will save you money & make a great cup of coffee, provided you use the right coffee. I've found you need to go with a stronger coffee than you would normally use because it comes out weaker than with the actual K-cups or a traditional coffee brewer. Use a stronger coffee & you won't be disappointed. I've had them for 8 or 9 months and they hold up."
407,1351123200,B0096RP89G,A2V9A4GGAQ259L,5,Delicious!,I have tried the coconut curry one and I absolutely loved it. The flavors are amazing. This is not your same old same old boring soup. I could eat it every day. Now I want to try all their other flavors from Campbell Go.

I am now on my computer with a nice hot cup of the Fog Chaser at my side. I like the fact that there are eight cups to an air tight bag, and that there is an external plastic container for storage after you open one of these bags. A very nice option which I will again use for future purchases."
410,1351123200,B007Y59HVM,A2ERWXZEUD6APD,5,Fog Chaser Coffee,"This coffee has a full body and a rich taste. The price is far below the ""other"" coffee in the K cup and does not use as much plastic."
411,1351123200,B007Y59HVM,A318AB05Z9WR6S,5,Good buy for k cups,This coffee is delicious. No issues with the packaging. No grounds in brewed cup. Great value! I'll buy other blends in the future. I consider myself a coffee snob and this exceeded my expectations.
412,1351123200,B000FBM3YK,A2XVOWD40JCFSZ,4,yummy cookies!,We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh.
413,1351123200,B006ZMYLKC,A2GEZOSPJ0SWMZ,5,My Favorite K-Cup!,"I absolutely love this hot cocoa! Our office purchased a Keurig brewer about a year ago, and while the brewer is fancy and very nice, I never had an opportunity to use it until now. You see, I'm not a coffee drinker at all. Coffee makes me jittery all day and I feel like my bones and veins are vibrating. Not what I need when I work with high schoolers all day! This hot chocolate k-cup is a perfect treat for me, especially now that the mornings in Southern California are a little cooler and crisper. The chocolate flavor is well balanced, not too rich and definitely not too ""pasty"". I hate it when the powder mixes have leave the residue in the bottom of the cup. I usually make my hot chocolate with milk when I use powder, but with this k-cup, water is just fine. I definitely plan on buying more all year!"
414,1351123200,B007Y59HVM,AZ60BJ1NNZO6D,5,San Francisco Fog Chaser,Not for the timid. Great flavor with a bit of a bitter bite. Longer it sits the better the taste. My number one choice.
415,1351123200,B008I1XPKA,A1X72EVJFHF8EA,5,Great Cup of Coffee,We enjoyed the Brooklyn K Cups very much. The price was right and it was very convenient to receive by mail. We would definitely consider ordering again.
416,1351123200,B000EDGB7E,A33RFE73ENQRPM,4,Healthy treats for the kids,My kids love these freeze dry fruits.  Great as a take  along snacks when we are on the go.  A little expensive for the amount of fruits you get. Will stock up the next time Amazon has these on sale (lighting deal).
417,1351123200,B000Z3VUEC,A3F6933AX1JNMQ,1,Did Not Like,I really wanted to like this tea. I was hoping it was going to be my new favorite especially after reading the reviews on here. I did not like it all and ended up taking it back to the store where I bought it. Luckily Wegmans let me return it. I also only paid $1.99 for a box. If you are used to drinking vanilla tea then this will not compare. It has a wierd flavor to me and even smell. I tried one bag with just water and another with cream and sugar and still hated it. Regarding the price I can not believe it costs this much on Amazon. I suggest checking your local stores at Christmas time and stocking up if you like it. Wegmans in upstate NY has it and it is only October.
418,1351123200,B008I1XPKA,A25D37J5IF44YK,5,Good coffee makes for a great morning.,I was very happy to find this deal.  Good price and excellent coffee. Gets my morning off to a good start.

420,1351123200,B004U8Z4MM,A3JR3NYF4RD23T,4,Very convenient,"Before I order anything online, I try to research as much as possible.  There were so many comments complaining about the packaging, stating that the litter was spilling out of the box when it arrived.  I was under the assumption that the Arm & Hammer box was shipped alone.  And that may be the case if shipped from another supplier, but I have a monthly subscription from Amazon. The 40lb litter box is placed in a different Amazon box before it ships.  Some of my litter spilled out too, but I just simply poured the 2 tablespoons back into the original box.  The subscription saves money and makes things so convenient, since it's delivered right to the door each month.  Then the shipping is free on top of all that.  Lifting 40lbs is no prob for me, but my girlfriend sure does appreciate the free delivery.<br />  Pertaining to the effectiveness of the litter......  I am a dog person, so being around cats is new to me.  I made my girlfriend try at least 10-12 different types of litter, and found that none of them work perfectly.  Arm & Hammer works for us since it meets most requirements better than others.  (masks odor better than any other I've tried, clumps well, inexpensive)  Then the subscription makes it so convenient.  This is a real unsolicited review....the type that I look for when I scan other reviews to help me make a decision.  I hope this helps someone."
421,1351123200,B000MT4HWG,A23NBI33FUN8F9,1,My Chihuahuas HATE This Product,"My two Chihuahuas loved ""Cadet Gourmet Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets"", the 32-Ounce package I had been buying at Costco.  However, I discovered it was made in China and feared this product could make them sick or cause death.  So I started searching for a company in the USA that made dog jerky treats.  I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag.  This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips.  My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away.  It doesn't even smell like duck.  Rather, it smells somewhat fishy.  A waste of my money!"
422,1351123200,B006N3I8ZW,A1QU5WEF3LS9YD,5,Twinings---a good cup of tea,I have been drinking Twining's tea for years.  It used to be made in England but now they have a plant in North Carolina for the American trade.  The tea is excellent. I drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea.

424,1351123200,B008NDSNH8,A1TWM78I835NGZ,5,"Mmmmmmm,  popcorn!",Great popcorn!  I'm a repeat buyer too.  One pack makes just a teeny bit more than my Whirly Pop can hold with the lid closed.  The kernels pop big and have a great flavor.  The hulls are farely tame for big kernels. My only suggestion for Wabash Valley Farms would be to boost the butter flavor just a smidge.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but popcorn popped on the stove top is so much better than microwaved.
425,1351123200,B008I1XPKA,ADZN913PN0G2C,1,Coffee Let Down,"I had high hopes for this coffee after reading some of the reviews; although some of the reviews were not so favorable either. I should have taken those into account before ordering this coffee. This coffee was awful. I tried it a few times on different water settings on my Keurig thinking that maybe a lower setting would help. Maybe a little, but certainly not much. It was bland and had hardly any flavor. I won't be ordering this coffee again."
426,1351123200,B006Q7YG2O,A7EU2BWLLCJY2,5,My dogs love them!,"I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies."
427,1351123200,B002A3NO9E,A2Q9EETPTSL36G,5,Excellent Kit,"I just want to say I feel extremely sorry for Danielle (the previous reviewer) and the people she gave these as gifts to.  For me, this has been wonderful and I intend on buying others.<br /><br />It takes a while, for sure, and what helped with mine was two things:<br />1.) Keeping a plastic bag over the bag the plant is in for an extremely long time, months even.  Once it gets growing...<br />2.) Transferring the plant into a self-watering pot and keeping it in as much sun as possible (I'm an indoor gardener lol).<br /><br />Now, for me, the trick is to get it to STOP growing. :)  Also, the oregano is DELICIOUS.  Anyway, these are cheap enough that I'd say they're worth a go.  I've had great luck with mine."
428,1351123200,B005STNE3S,A1SSZEZA8U2RNK,5,Perfect for Dig Pink,These were perfect for my red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for a Dig Pink volleyball game! Everyone loved them and they softened into a frosting consistency after sprinking them on the previous night. Loved them!

My fingers get messed up and once you get to the middle it gets even more difficult.<br /><br />If someone could design a better way to get the product out that is like this, i would love to buy this product more."
432,1351123200,B000SATIVO,AJAS77J3NW4T1,4,"Worth the money, but nothing to write home about.","First of all, shipping and packaging went very well. I'm impressed in that regard. After reading the previous review, I was kind of expecting to be blown away by the wonderful smell and taste. I'm not saying it tastes or smells bad, but it's not as amazing as the other reviewer puts it. The fragrance and taste is hard to describe, but good. I brewed it at a relatively hot temperature for about 6 minutes, and added sugar with it. The tea tastes fruity but with a cinnamon kick to it as well as floral undertones. I would recommend this product to another person, but I don't think I'll be able to use all 16oz of it. Buying a smaller bag might be a good idea."
433,1351123200,B008I1XPKA,A3QAP0MHEJK3UW,4,No coffe ground in my cup,I have read the reviews and noticed some complaints of coffee ground residual left after brewing. I have tried ALL of the blends and I have not had a single problem.<br />My kuerig is over a year old and I can honestly say this coffee is very good and a reasonable price!<br />I was so thrilled when the new hazelnut flavor came out and it is very flavor filled and  no unpleasant aftertaste. I give it a solid 4 as the only way it would get a 5 is if I brewed a whole pot and I can't with my k-cups<br /><br />BUY !! you will not be sorry
434,1351123200,B007Y59HVM,AILQNWAHVRY91,5,This Coffee is WONDERFUL!!!!!!,"I was a little skeptical about the lack of plastic cup around the base of the ""K-Cup"".

I have put these on auto delivery now!!! yay! Thanks Amazon for offering such great products!!!!!!!"
435,1351123200,B007RTR9DS,A1WXFL6IXQKAM5,4,Does what it says it will.,"The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm does exactly what it says it'll do; it moisturizes and protects hair, it has a pleasant scent, and the scalp feels better after it's been used.<br /><br />The only thing to warn you about is that this product does not seem made for my particular type of hair; instead, I think if you have much coarser hair than I do, this product would be much better for you than it was for me.  Mostly, I believed this helped me some, but I think it would help someone with very coarse hair far more.<br /><br />But it works, and it does what it says it will, which is why it deserves a four-star rating.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey"
436,1351209600,B0012C2GFM,A2T28XGN21AZ0A,2,Super healthy but tastes like ass,"I have no idea what these people are thinking saying this stuff tastes great. They must work for Nutiva or have a friend who does.<br />This stuff is super healthy, I'm sure - but tastes friggin' awful. It's like cardboard pulp. I make smoothies with it which my mom said look like diarrhea.<br /><br />I'm stuck with this huge 3 lb bag - which, in its defense - is a fantastic bargain. But I got it in 2010 and I'm still trying to choke it down two years later. Spend the extra money and get yourself some Vega. It's certainly pricier, but you get what you pay for."

What a nice surprise when I found out I can easily order it here on Amazon in the US!<br />Basically this is 2/3 real sea salt and 1/3 herb salt (like celery salt and such) so you can cut on salt without even thinking about it.<br />The taste? So much better than dumb salt, it adds a wonderful but subtle herb/vegetables flavor (kinda like a bouquet garni?).<br />Everybody loves it, husband, friends, grandma and brother in law, everybody.<br />Best way to enjoy it? Fresh bread, butter, sprinkle the salt on the top of the ""tartine"" and eat with fresh radish! Yum!<br /><br />My mother always insist on sending me some from France ""But Mom I can just order it from Amazon here!"".<br />It's hard to believe that 50 years ago, this was just a local product and now it's sold on Amazon in the US. But it totally deserves it! Thank you Alfred Vogel for offering us healthy AND yummy products since 1963! Way before organic products were trendy.<br />This is a true 6 stars product."

I received an email back from Starbucks that my order had been canceled. No explanation at all, just that it had been canceled. I checked back on Amazon and see that this item is still available but they had raised the price.<br /><br />So instead of honoring the price they just blew me off like the sale never happened.  Shame on Amazon for allowing a seller to do this.<br /><br />Bottom line, Amazon has gone down a few points in my eyes.  Greedy Starbucks can keep their coffee."

It only takes a few little crisps to cure my salty/crunchy craving. I can snack on one package for an entire day. Of course these would not be a good snack if you're very hungry, because there isn't enough there to fill you up. For less than $1 per pack it's an okay deal."

452,1351209600,B0034WSXIC,A2EOLZ2F8PG87D,5,Awsome Figs,I am an big lover of fig jam and this fig jam has a very unique flavor. Kind of a mix between the light kadoda  figs and the dark mission figs. Must try it!
453,1351209600,B006N3IE6A,A3GFZIL1E0Z5V8,5,Rodeo Drive is Crazy Good Coffee!,Rodeo Drive is my absolute favorite and I'm ready to order more!  That's if I can find it.<br />I don't know why they are discontinuing it.<br />It arrived very fast.
454,1351209600,B002Y3CSD8,ATL8TGSAEMDV1,5,I would buy it again,"I decided to try this sauce recently and overall I thought it was delicious.  I've had Pad Thai at many different restaurants around Chicago and Boston, and my version of Pad Thai using this sauce felt less ""greasy"" as my wife put it.  Another reviewer commented that the flavor was not ""authentic""; whether this is true or not, it was still good.  In the future I may try a different sauce just to compare, but I would have no problems buying this sauce again."
455,1351209600,B0029NU2E0,A1HKHIP6VCMALP,3,Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough,"When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses ""...it's mostly water,"" our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the ""beef and liver"" chunks in the future."
456,1351209600,B0054ES1MG,A25QCYSED869Q3,5,If you like mint candy......,"This is the best hard mint candy in the world.  Expensive, though.  I can't find it in stores.  Anyone know where I can get it off-line?"
457,1351209600,B001BOE3UW,A18J98YVUMMDOA,5,You can taste the ginger.,"I love these ginger candy, tastes like ginger nothing added but natural ingredients.  I got them because the were gluten free.  My daughter took them to school for her teachers with colds, I handed them out to my neighbours.  I will be getting more."
458,1351209600,B004FD13RW,A1BPLP0BKERV,5,It is awesome.,"My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it."
459,1351209600,B000LKTXMU,A2J3PR6J36UTVH,5,Michael Seasons Unsalted Potato Chips,"These are the best chips ever!  They are unsalted and being on a low sodium diet critical in allowing my husband and I to eat chips.  They are all natural and low fat which is a great extra bonus.  Additionally they have the BEST flavor...you really taste the potato flavor and not the salt!  I would choose these chips over ANY chip on the market today, salted or not!! These chips as well as ANY unsalted chips are very hard to find in the stores so THANK YOU Amazon for selling them."
460,1351209600,B000RZNY5G,A2ZGTXBI8C7FYI,5,YUMMY,"Very good, still have a little left. I like the salty taste (that's why I buy them)  Not too salty nuts are open and easy to pop out"

462,1351209600,B000RNENU8,A1BCHCP9C7ZE8B,5,Works like a charm and easy to use,"We have a lot of container plants, including a fig tree, tomatoes, roses, etc., and they need regular fertilizing.  Mixing granular fertilizer into a bucket is messy, so I switched to liquid Miracle-Gro and have been very happy with it.  People remark on how healthy and productive our rooftop garden is.  For use of use and results this is well worth the cost."
463,1351209600,B0083COD6O,A1DOLU6HS6R05M,5,Great flavor!,"I purchased this in a local health foods store, and loved it right away. I've tried other almond milks, and always found them to have a gritty or grainy aftertaste. Not so with this drink. It's very smooth. I could have this in cereal or my fave chai latte's or straight out of the box. Love it!"
464,1351209600,B005HI55CS,A36ERNIM0TKG3T,5,Hidden Springs Maple syrup,"This is one of the very finest maple syrups I have ordered and enjoyed. I bought the Fancy Grade, for the light amber color. It has a very great taste. I will reorder."
465,1351209600,B0033HPPIO,A2U3RRCA2URS56,5,Delish!!,So yummy... Drinking it Black coffee or w cream this coffee is delish .... One of my favs... I would recommend this coffee to everyone :)
466,1351209600,B008FXKOKK,A3RKYD8IUC5S0N,5,Tasty and works!,"First off, my cat HATES regular Greenies (the big crunchy ones) and won't even try to lick them. Any flavor. But my big fluffy Himalayan was hacking up stinky furballs in unreachable places, so when I saw these at the pet store I bought them on a whim.<br /><br />She loves them! I don't think she even chews the things, she inhales them so fast. Tuna treats are ok but chicken were more popular around here. She likes these better than the Temptations treats she had before, and I am convinced that these are somewhat healthier.<br /><br />The pouch recommends 12 treats a day, all at once, or even more for my big-boned cat. I usually do more like 5-6, because that many treats seems excessive (she would love it though). Either way, she hasn't had any hairballs since. I am not positive about the causal relationship, but I suspect these did the trick. They're great!"
467,1351209600,B002QZ2AZ0,A18PSXOI64YFZC,3,its delicious...,I was surprised at how delicious these toasted chips are. They ship well with little damage. I have ordered them several times. Also they are very fresh. Not one bit was left in the bag when I got through.
468,1351209600,B002ULC2V2,A4VW6XVS48EMF,5,Seeds!,"I love sunflower seeds and I have found that Planters has the best tasting, fresh and delicious ones out there!  they are hard to find so i am glad I found them on Amazon, I recommend to all to give these a try!!!"
469,1351209600,B007PA32OE,A3UOYYQS5Z47MS,5,Morning Coffee,Great coffee at a good price. I'm a subscription buyer and I buy this month after month. What more can I say?
470,1351209600,B0042WXFJU,A1ESX96TOYF8X5,5,Really tasty,I never thought I'd buy this type of item but tried it at C****o when they had one of their numerous taste tests.  Both my 8 year old and I liked it.  So good for you and reasonably priced there especially with an instant coupon! Comes in a 4 pack box for under $10.
471,1351209600,B000KOT5O8,A2KD4B8AZMAWJU,5,Fantastic Flavor! Great for Tuna Steaks!!,Why would someone pay almost $15 for this product (although the taste is worth it)when you can get it for less. Check your prices before paying too much.
472,1351209600,B007KPFSJ6,A506HOOCVL8GW,5,BEST cup of coffee I've ever had!,"I thought I'd splurge and try this coffee.  It costs much more than other decaf K-Cup options.  But I hoped that meant it was better coffee.  It IS better coffee.  I've never had a better cup of coffee than this.  It is excellent when compared to any other decaf or regular coffee I've tried.<br /><br />If you like BOLD, FLAVORFUL decaf coffee try this coffee and you'll really like it."
473,1351209600,B002J771J0,A1TED4G0PWZPQV,1,Was rotten,"Culd not eat it, but the other flavor I ordered was fine, not sure why it was not ok, when the other one was"
474,1351209600,B00196P9PA,A3D9688QO6PLGD,1,Disappointed,The metal cover has severely disformed. And most of the cookies inside have been crushed into small pieces. Shopping experience is awful. I'll never buy it online again.
475,1351209600,B0045TI2HU,A62DE4ONLWSD,5,Sugar-Free Brownies - Diabetes related issue,"Extremely satisfied... got precisely what I ordered and wanted.  I appreciate that we are permitted to modify the order while still keeping it in force.  Next time the option appears, I will either spread it out to more than three months or reduce the number.  Six boxes in three months maybe a bit more than I need as I am told to cut back/eliminate.  But these are a great way to get my chocolate fix.  Only the CHOC FUDGE is carried by our stores, but the MILK CHOC is what I prefer.<br /><br />On a similar note, why do stores limit their sugar free inventory?  Because they do is why I had to come online to purchase this product.  I had made requests at our local stores to carry this product, but it was not accommodated."
476,1351209600,B0001M0ZWA,AUEA2NJHMK9DF,4,Like this tea,This tea has a nice flavor although I wish it was a little stronger.  I have brewed way it states and even tried letting it sit longer  to get a stronger cup but it didn't work.  Am pleased with purchase and flavor overall.
477,1351209600,B005F0JM7W,A3U9177XF7ZF3P,5,"Works great, simple install.",I bought two of these. Easy to install and works great. The only problem is now my wife is buying more K-cups.
478,1351209600,B0001TNCK0,A1GCFTFXELCHRP,4,Still unsure about its benefits.,"ACV is supposed to help maintain the immune system, help lose weight, along with many other claims.  I know that drinking a tablespoon of ACV, diluted with a glass of water, once per day, has helped me; but I haven't seen the benefits of the pill yet.  Only been taking it for 2 weeks though, but it's certainly much more manageable than drinking directly.  PS:  Still smells awful though."
479,1351209600,B0005YW0TU,A22SW4MALCSDWV,1,Inedible,"I am one of the least picky eaters that I know, but I had to throw my bowl out after a few spoons of this.  It was disgusting and inedible.  I wonder if anyone at these big companies try their products before marketing them.  The flavor was heavily artificial with strong off-notes of bitterness and tree bark.  Dont believe me?  Go ahead and try it."
480,1351209600,B008JKTTUA,AEY5NHLOAWM21,3,The Kind Plus item was sticky,"I have no complaint about the product itself. I likely would have rated it very good had it not been subjected excessive heat somewhere along, before it arrived. Although I ate them, each one was sticking to the wrapper and<br />difficult to eat without sticky deposits on my face and hands."
481,1351209600,B001PICX42,A13W6WYHKSKAT,5,Favorite fruits snacks!,"I try to buy only organic when it comes to my kids and my son is obsessed with fruit snacks. I discovered these a couple yrs ago and fell in love right away. Not only does my son love them, but I do too! Plus, I love how soft they are! I don't worry about my younger son, who is 1.5, choking on them because they are very easy to chew. I also love how they sell them in only berry flavors because I have never been fond of citrus flavored candy and I like to eat these just as much as my kids. lol"
482,1351209600,B003TNANSO,AEY5NHLOAWM21,3,The Kind Plus item was sticky,"I have no complaint about the product itself. I likely would have rated it very good had it not been subjected excessive heat somewhere along, before it arrived.

483,1351209600,B001P05K8Q,A3L0B5NBTQ7ZHO,4,Great results but they stink,"We originally purchased these chews from our veterinarian. Decided to order them here from Amazon because of the reduced cost and lack of shipping temperature restrictions on the product. We get complimented on the whiteness of our dogs' ""smiles"" all the time. Our vet is happy and so am I because I don't have to brush their teeth a lot! You definitely want to wash your hands after handling the chews because they have a peculiar odor.  Now if someone can figure out how to ship heart worm prevention without it getting too hot, I'd be ecstatic!"
484,1351209600,B0029ZAOW8,AYTSBGA5A3UWI,5,A God Sent Remedy!!!,I love this stuff! It's a God sent Remedy for hangovers!.... I understand the health concerns many people have and I can also see that this can be habit forming. I make sure I only take one every so often and not everyday.
485,1351209600,B002RBRY0Y,A11LYF3HM1QQK7,3,very delicious,"This is my very favorite of the truffles. It is a medium dark and very delicious. If I have one, it screams at me to have just one more! As long as they are made, I will be first in line to purchase."

487,1351209600,B0084MBGNQ,A3F526Y77Y64KT,5,Great Outdoor Dog Treat,I have two Weims that have a strong need to chew. These bones serve that need very well.  Be sure to keep the bones in an area where you don't have to worry about stains as they are greasy.
488,1351209600,B000QSON4K,A2I606SLG4SWHF,5,Perfect for Giving Medications to Our Dogs,"Every month, we give our three dogs (two Aussies and a Golden/Flat-Coat Retriever mix) pills for flea/tick/worm repellant.  In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.  We found Pill Pockets is the very best way to do this.  Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.  Everybody is happy, and the dogs get the required meds."
489,1351209600,B0046IIPMW,A27IEA7DADM64W,5,Great for a Paleo diet,I've been eating a strict Paleo eating diet for nearly one year and including Ghee has been a huge taste benefit. Ghee has virtually no lactose and is healthier than regular butter. I brush this on my chicken breasts and then bake them with a a bit of crushed black pepper and sunflower seeds. The flavor really comes out with so few ingredients. This brand and another one are two of my favorite and they are usually listed with Prime available.
490,1351209600,B007O17V2I,A1571CSWXSP125,5,Oat Bran,This oat bran was great as a cereal & pancakes.  Just adjust your recipes to your diet & add the oat bran.  Great!
491,1351209600,B003VN97GQ,A20DC4NK8YMOQT,5,One of the Best Dressings Around,"As stated above, a great salad dressing at a great price,  especially when you purchase the cruet as an accessory included in the package. When ever I serve this to guests, most are not aware that this is a packaged dressing (I doctor it up a bit), until I tell them.<br />A good inexpensive gift for your favorite cook."
492,1351209600,B006392MMG,A36ERNIM0TKG3T,5,Hidden Springs Maple syrup,"This is one of the very finest maple syrups I have ordered and enjoyed. I bought the Fancy Grade, for the light amber color. It has a very great taste. I will reorder."
493,1351209600,B000NM1BHQ,A2JDXKFZ0PFHKU,2,Received broken,I bought these to use as decorative center pieces for a birthday party. The packaging looked nice but when going through the candies to put in my decor I noticed that over half of them (43 to be exact) were broken and unusable.
494,1351209600,B0065AOUKK,A1KRZB2K7O6XC,5,Yummy!,Got this for my brother & nephew and they just love it!!  Said it's better than regular hot chocolate. Allows whole family to use the Kuerig so not just for coffee.
495,1351209600,B0012VSXIM,A2TOUMUWSN7FJY,5,Good & Plenty Licorice Candy,If you like licorice you will love this candy.  I can remember eating this candy from a box at the local movie theatre when I was a kid and it is still just as good.
496,1351209600,B000FACFIA,A1TTGEM50SIS2R,5,"Licorice Scottie Dogs, Red",I love the Gimbals Red Licorice Scottie dogs I purchased from Candy Crate.  The price per pound was less than I paid from another source and the purchase qualified for free shipping.  I'll be back...........for more when my supply is gone!
497,1351209600,B0019GZ7Z2,ANSBPV2CZVZ39,4,Great product,"This is a wonderful flour to use. low carbs, and full of nutrients. I dont use it though because it has a very strong sweet coconuty flavor and I am not a coconut kind of person. If I DO add it, it is a minute amount. But defintiely number one flour to buy and use..even for baking for your doggie cookies. I only gave it 4 stars cause of the taste."
498,1351209600,B0049K99RW,A1Y73Y4VX3AJMZ,4,Nice traditional chai,"I got hooked on this chai when I decided to give up coffee.  It still has a little bit of caffeine, but much less than coffee does.  It's nice and spicy (you really get the flavor of black pepper) and actually easy to prepare.  Initially, I thought it was too complicated to boil water and then add milk separately, but it allows you to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.  If you want sweet, you add your own sweetener - I usually use a spoonful of white sugar or honey.  After drinking this stuff, I tried some pre-sweetended mix, and there was no comparison.  This stuff tastes ""real"" and without chemicals or preservatives."
499,1351209600,B0024NUM7W,A1SFA2BYES0OH,3,"eh,,ok, but...","I love popcorn, and this product is good except for the fact that it does not and will not give you the taste that you are looking for that you get from movie theaters. Even with the matching seasoning salt, it doesn't do the justice. But its ok,just not buttery at all."
500,1351209600,B000OH97Y4,A25QGGBI6NGHNY,3,Trying a different food,"Because our Rottweiler has some skin issues, we are trying the ProPlan Selects Natural Salmon and Brown Rice food. We are beginning our 3rd bag via subscribe and save. So far, our dog likes it and we haven't had enough time to know if its doing better than the Blue Buffalo we used before. I am thinking of adding Salmon oil.<br /><br />The only negative we have is the kibble is small. My dog sometimes gets choked on the little kibble, so I am going to try and stick with this form, but find a larger kibble. Overall, this is a great food."
501,1351209600,B0006345OI,A21YJCM7MR97BS,5,fine for 13 y.o. doggy,"My Am Staff is about 13 years old and is a very ""food-driven"" dog. He seems to like this version of Eukanuba just fine, although he is not a picky eater at all! The kibble seems to be a good size for him; some brands of ""large dog"" food are twice as big, which might be hard for older guys like mine!<br /><br />The price of these 30 lbs bags has gone up from the $40 range to the $50 range, but I know it is better for my dog than the Pedigree that is readily available at Smart & Final, so I stick with this Eukanuba.<br /><br />Plus, you all know the benefits of feeding your dog higher-quality dry food when you go out for a ""walk,"" right? ;-)"
502,1351209600,B005H7WARC,A2L3AP3898XNDI,5,Great stuff,A co-worker recommended that I try Coconut Oil to make my hair softer and less dry. After a little resource of my own I purchased some. It was the miracle hair product I needed. It has been 2 months and my hair has grown soo much. Its healthier and softer than it has ever been.

504,1351209600,B000H7LVKY,A3GZ140SEBF9GI,5,Yum,"This is my third box of the cherries.  I love putting a handful on my cereal in the morning.  They are very sweet and just a bit tart.  They are also great in salads and make a awesome muffin.<br /><br />I will say that there seems to be some seasonal variation.  One of the three boxes I received wasn't quite as tart/sweet as the other two.  They were still very good but not ""as"" good."
505,1351209600,B004CQYODW,AM2ADIDTH4SI4,5,Bing,I love that I can still get this product in California even though it is not sold in any stores! Everyone who sees it is jealous that they don't have one!
506,1351209600,B000CPZSC8,ABEPJJLWMXXTD,5,"Plump, juicy vanilla beans","These are plump, juicy vanilla beans! Perfect for ice cream making and making vanilla extract. Very satisfied and will not buy expensive vanilla beans at the grocery store ever again."
507,1351209600,B0015A2W32,A1SEHFQQ30AR0E,5,Perfect,"I was a little worried when I saw the reviews about them arriving melty but there were enough good reviews that I took a shot.  They arrived perfectly and within 24 hours of ordering them using two days shipping.  If you really want Andes Mints, and like me, you can't find them at any of the local stores around you, then take a shot.  As for the product itself, if you're searching for andes mints on Amazon, you are probably already aware of how great they are.  Definitely five stars for me for both the products and the shipping."
508,1351209600,B004CYLW7A,A2CMS7BYL8BKP1,1,Yuk! And who goes to Amazon to buy cereal?????,"This stuff tasted like (insert favorite negative adjective that Amazon won't print). I like most cereals but I couldn't put this stuff down, tasted like cardboard something with a half stale texture. Hate to throw 3/4 box of cereal away, we'll see if the birds will eat it - I have my doubts."
509,1351209600,B001EQ5KTK,A3GS4GWPIBV0NT,5,Love this tea,This is a favorite of mine for using over ice. Even bought it to give out as Christmas gifts last year.
510,1351209600,B0042WXFJU,A1X1592EDWIJU4,4,"Tasty, but....","I don't know how they can label these as lentils.  ""Lentils"" is the third ingredient listed.  The first two are water, and tomatoes.  Having said that, it's a nicely seasoned tomato soup with some lentils in it.  Just not what I thought I was buying."

512,1351209600,B007689U8W,A3FW29GQ2BNLHI,5,Outstanding!,Fantastic flavor! The dark chocolate is creamy and rich but not bitter or overpowering like some dark chocolates can be. Perfectly balanced raspberry/chocolate flavor.
513,1351209600,B005ZBZLT4,A308RR8J9NJOOZ,5,One of the best!,"I am recently new to the Keurig world.  I've tried a handful of flavors since I've gotten my machine, and have been just ok with most of the flavors tried.  Fog Chaser has restored my faith in my investment!  Try this!  Coffee shop taste and at a better price than Keurig K Cups!"
514,1351209600,B004ZY4TK4,A4IL0CLL27Q33,1,Buyer beware,"Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here)."

My friends know this, so when they travel they often bring me teas from overseas to try. Years ago, a friend gave me some English Breakfast Tea from her trip to Britain. What a full-bodied tea that was! When I had the opportunity to try this I jumped at it, assuming it would be identical. Although close, this is not quite as strong as the tea my friend bought in London.<br /><br />I do like the blend of Ceylon and Assam. It has that nice zing that cuts through a hearty breakfast, like the traditional English fry-up, but still tastes delicious with milk and sugar or honey. Be careful not to oversteep, though, or it can get quite bitter."

I was a little skeptical about it at first because it is so inexpensive, but I tried it at a wine tasting and I got hooked!  It has a wonderful favor and it actually has a taste of red velvet.  This is a great wine for any occasion, but especially for the holidays.  And even though it has the taste of red velvet, its not a sweet wine like a port.  I've also seen this wine available at BevMo, Costco, Bed Bath & Beyond and World Market.  Cheers!"

Cornstarch and Wondra for thickening left lots of lumps in gravy which took alot of time to blend out with my emulsion blender. Ultratex as thickening agent made for a nice silky gravy.

I bought two bags of vanilla beans, slit them down the middle, scraped out the ""caviar,"" cut the beans into fourths, crammed them down into the bottom of a dark wine bottle, followed by the ""caviar"" and followed it up by pouring a really nice vodka - in my case, Finlandia, which I got in the duty-free store on my last cruise on Holland America Line - and corked the bottle and shook it every day for a week. The instructions are to now shake it once a week for the next six months. I am now at the end of the second week and the fragrance of the vanilla is absolutely intoxicating. You can't help but open it up every once in a while. It is getting darler and darker by the day and supposedly, making your own big bottle of vanilla extract will last ten years. What a great tip my client gave me and I'm forever grateful to her AND to J. R. Mushrooms for providing such heavenly vanilla beans. It'll be hard not to Dan some behind my ears'"

It is also excellent at the end of the day, once the kids are in bed, to use as a dipping sauce with some bread and your favorite glass of wine."

When I opened this last shipment I found some hemp seed scattered throughout the box.  I carefully removed the first of two pouches and found a 1"" rip in the middle of the front of the bag.  Most of the product was still in the pouch and appeared fresh and undamaged so I transferred it to a container.  The other pouch was intact.  I hope this is a one-time occurrence, and I will be ordering this again when I need more.  More care needs to be taken to assure that the pouches are handled properly and that they are all in good condition when packed."

When buying these particular mixes here in bulk of 6 boxes they came out to be so much cheaper than buying them in my stores in my area. So delicious sweet treat and cheaper price is a steal!!! The Chocolate cake mix and brownie mix are definately NOT cheaper to puchase this way here for some reason.

I've tried several of Bob's Red Mill cereals and they are ALL absolutely fantastic!  This cereal has a delicious flavor and creamy texture.  I usually add some dried fruit and raw almonds to give it another flavor dimension.  Even by itself it is superior to ""quick"" oats and other grocery store breakfast choices.  On a side note I enjoy supporting the little guys and a simple Google search will show you what a good company Bob's Red Mill is.  Kudos!"

555,1351209600,B000LKU3K6,A2YRK0YLBN5CC2,3,"Good flavor, but a wet mess","I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

562,1351209600,B000KEPBBY,A3GS4GWPIBV0NT,3,Ok but not what I thought,"This is basically split peas, lentils and small soup pasta.  I guess I expected to find more dried vegetables, perhaps seasoning of some sort but this is a VERY simple base which you will build your soup from.  I think a better names for this would be 'split pea soup base' or 'split pea and pasta'. With a more accurate name I would give it a higher rating because the quality was good but I felt a little misguided by the name and description proveded when I received my order."

Perfect or the cooler weather, autumn, winter, early Spring.  Fireside name changed to Firelight but both images are perfect for imagining sitting by a fire sipping this, or just warming your hands around the cup.  The bagged version must be ground; this version has whole cloves and kind of prickly pieces of spicy leaves, but is fine to steep as is.  Really worth the cost."

Anyways, we have been ordering it ever since and love it. If you are an ice tea lover, this is the best you can use. It has this subtle kind of passion fruit like after taste.. which compliments every time you take a sip and exhale."

My husband had installed the same one in our old house so when our current faucet was leaking I told him not to fix it and we would buy the same one.  It was easy enough for him to install but he did need my assistance a few times to help hold some things in place. Looks great and works great.

590,1351209600,B003G52BN0,A2O4V3MCB7EPPU,4,One of my favorite K-cups flavors,This is one of my favorite k-cup flavors.  The coffee roast is mild and has just the right amount of coconut flavor. It is not over powering or cloying.  I like to brew this on the second to largest size setting (on my machine) and add one splenda and liquid carmel creamer.  It sounds like a weird combo but it's really good.  It's my Saturday morning go to coffee combo.
591,1351209600,B004NZ0JIQ,A2K082DNME4G2P,5,Delicious!!!!,"A coffee treat. Now that my husband and I drink this coffee, there is no going back to the plain stuff ;)."

Unfortunately the postal carrier decided not to leave this shipment due to rain. Fine if you can't bag it than leave a delivery notice and re-attempt. Not so. Who knows how long it would have sat in the local post office if I hadn't have tracked the package. I finally called and after getting a bit of a run around they agreed to deliver it the next day if it didn't rain. It didn't and I had left instructions for the carrier in case of rain. Still all in all my delivery experience has not been an issue with Amazon.<br /><br />Now, as I've found several other subscribe and save items, the price just went up so I can buy it cheaper locally. Really disappointed as I like the convenience of having it delivered. This product has had no price increases locally in well over a year so I'm a bit confused why Amazon needed to raise it's price."
595,1351209600,B000G1CG50,A3VBVJ6UG09MFC,5,Yummy Chummies,All my dogs love them. Healthy treats. Not great for training as they crumble when you try to break them into pieces
596,1351209600,B003YZ3MN0,A10J6HSUU9ZAGJ,5,Best beans your money can buy,"These are, hands down, the best jelly beans on the market.  There isn't a gross one in the bunch and each of them has an intense, delicious flavor.  Though I hesitate to pick a favorite, I have to say that I love green apple, a rare flavor in drugstore jelly beans.  Each flavor tastes like the fruit it is modeled after, not like the tart candy version of that fruit.  I even love the cherry flavor, and I hate cherry flavored candy.  I don't find them similar to Starburst candy, so don't let that put you off if you're not a fan.  Overall, they are delicious, perfectly-sized, crunchy yet smooth little morsels of fruit flavor."
597,1351209600,B001ELJJRY,A3UCQK5288MQ98,5,Great wine,"I bought this wine kit because I wanted to find a nice white wine that I could let age a while before I gave it to any family or friends.  When this wine was complete, it tasted a little thin to me.  However, 3.5 months of aging brought it a lot way and it tastes wonderful.  I highly recommend this kit if you just want to make a batch of wine to age and enjoy down the road.  I can only imagine how good it will taste in another 6 months to a year."

600,1351209600,B0039JXQ1Y,AUEA2NJHMK9DF,4,Like this tea,This tea has a nice flavor although I wish it was a little stronger.  I have brewed way it states and even tried letting it sit longer  to get a stronger cup but it didn't work.  Am pleased with purchase and flavor overall.
601,1351209600,B0099HD3YA,A4M1YK1RDM82I,5,A great coffee experience,"We have used pretty much every coffee brewing method, but I think for home or office use the Nespresso is best. We also have and use a Kurig. For larger cups of coffee we use it. But for the small tasty concentrated cups (expresso) we always use the Nespresso. The variety pack has a good variety of blends; coffee tastes fresh. In combine with the machine (we bought one without all the bells & whistles), it is simple to use and clean. My office bought one of the nespresso machines; then I bought one for home. It came very well packaged and with good set up directions. To be a perfect experience, the capsules would be more readily available -- you will find the machines, but not the capsules at many places."

608,1351209600,B004FQYYFM,A2YMQWU9WDPNEU,5,Great!,"Tastes great, really nice that samples came with, convenient. Not as great as loose leaf (personal favorite). I thought it was a little pricey but I re-use each stick at least once so that helps. I would buy again or suggest to others. Aa a matter of fact, I've given out 4 at work and everyone loves them!"
609,1351209600,B001BS4G6O,A2I606SLG4SWHF,5,Perfect for Giving Medications to Our Dogs,"Every month, we give our three dogs (two Aussies and a Golden/Flat-Coat Retriever mix) pills for flea/tick/worm repellant.  In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.  We found Pill Pockets is the very best way to do this.  Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.  Everybody is happy, and the dogs get the required meds."

I received an email back from Starbucks that my order had been canceled. No explanation at all, just that it had been canceled. I checked back on Amazon and see that this item is still available but they had raised the price.<br /><br />So instead of honoring the price they just blew me off like the sale never happened.  Shame on Amazon for allowing a seller to do this.<br /><br />Bottom line, Amazon has gone down a few points in my eyes.  Greedy Starbucks can keep their coffee."

You can now eat Mitt Romney's bowel movement!,"Year after year I would lie awake in bed, thinking, hoping, wishing for the one day I could purchase a likeness of a major political figure that actually defecates candy. Well, every once in awhile, dreams do come true. This defecating Romney doll is all I hoped for! Unlike the real Gov. Romney, though, who passes actual fecal matter (on a rather regular schedule, I'm sure), the doll empties its bowels of candy! (it should be noted the candy, thank goodness, is not fecal flavored). This will share a treasured space with my NASCAR toilet seat and my mounted rubber fish that sings Roy Orbison tunes."
618,1351209600,B008FXKOI2,A3RKYD8IUC5S0N,5,Tasty and works!,"First off, my cat HATES regular Greenies (the big crunchy ones) and won't even try to lick them. Any flavor. But my big fluffy Himalayan was hacking up stinky furballs in unreachable places, so when I saw these at the pet store I bought them on a whim.<br /><br />She loves them! I don't think she even chews the things, she inhales them so fast. Tuna treats are ok but chicken were more popular around here. She likes these better than the Temptations treats she had before, and I am convinced that these are somewhat healthier.<br /><br />The pouch recommends 12 treats a day, all at once, or even more for my big-boned cat. I usually do more like 5-6, because that many treats seems excessive (she would love it though). Either way, she hasn't had any hairballs since. I am not positive about the causal relationship, but I suspect these did the trick. They're great!"

622,1351209600,B0029NSI46,A1HKHIP6VCMALP,3,Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough,"When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses ""...it's mostly water,"" our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the ""beef and liver"" chunks in the future."
623,1351209600,B0000CFXYA,A3GS4GWPIBV0NT,1,Strange inflammation response,Truthfully wasn't crazy about the taste of these but reason for the low rating is more to post a heads up warning. I noticed a trend in drinking this with a headache response. From an old neck injury I could get headaches from reinjuring or aggravating it. This tea triggered that same response which was very surprising. It made me think that many people could be triggering similar inflammation without ever tracing it back to the tea.  So just heads up if you are susceptible to this type of pain.

But I hoped that meant it was better coffee.  It IS better coffee.  I've never had a better cup of coffee than this.

630,1351209600,B008LFAS08,A3TB0KS3CCQ1K0,5,Best grinder I have had bar none!!!!,"This is the 3rd meat grinder I have purchased, and the best by far.  We make our own raw diet for our cats, so a grinder gets<br />a real workout from us.  We grind at least 40# of meat at a time when we use it.  With the other two grinders we had to reverse the grinder several times because meat got hung up.  Also, we would have to let it ""cool down"".  With this one we have NEVER had to reverse it, and the motor stays cool.  We do shut it down several times so we can crack the chicken leg bones with a mallet (we were told to do that by the manufacturer) and we do a bunch of legs at a time.  I would recommend this grinder to anyone wanting a GOOD grinder that<br />doesn't hang up and have to be reversed or cooled down often.  This grinder is a real worker, and I would compare this with a grinder costing 3-4 times as much money."

638,1351209600,B005BPVE90,AGZEK96T7WK6,3,"Very tasty, very filling, not that nutritious","I really enjoyed these and was surprised at how much they remind me of a ""normal"" chocolate-oatmeal-raisin cookie. But I don't really feel they should be called nutrition bars, as while they have 28% RDA of dietary fiber per bar, they have only 4g of protein, 4% RDA of calcium and 8% RDA of iron, and that's it; no other vitamins/minerals. When I hear ""nutrition bar"" I'm expecting a bit more than that. Even so, they are tasty and filling and only 200 calories per bar so I'll buy some from time to time for those ""rushed mornings"" when a decent breakfast is impossible."

I started drinking lipton green tea at work and loved it. Small caffeine boost, great flavor, no calories, etc. Read about white teas online so I gave this a try. The price is incredible. The tea reminds me of a tea I drank at a Chinese restaurant when I was young. Brings back good childhood memories, love the flavor. WILL BUY AGAIN."

We gave these to 4th graders who were equally impressed with the exterior soft spikes and the juicy center.  The fruits arrived in good condition, just slightly bruised.  The kept well in the fridge in a single-double layer covered with a damp paper towel.  I had also rinsed in a vinegar-water (1:10 parts) solution to be sure to inhibit any mold (like I do with berries).  They kept from Saturday when they arrived to Thursday with minimal browning.  I ordered 4 pounds and had plenty of fruits for the 40 kids.  I think there were about 55 - 60 fruits all together.  It was a fantastic treat and the kids were requesting we bring them again for the Halloween party!  I'm sure they'll remember the presentation for a long time."

If you are planning to visit Central Florida on vacation this is a good buy to prep your immune system against the local flora.

I came across this while searching Amazon, so glad I gave it a try!.. ""try it"" I do not think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />I have added the chopped up chicken as suggested but i also added small chopped onion, it is unbelievable! Another great way to make it even better is try adding fresh Mango while it is simmering or if you cant find it fresh, use canned mango nectar, substitute 1/4 cup of the water for the mango juice. Super Good!. Also instead of 2 1/2 cups water as suggested  use only 2 1/4 cups water, brings out the flavor a little bit more I think (2 cups water / 1/4 cup mango nectar)."

It is not grain free -- as it does have Brown Rice in it (listed as the 8th ingredient, so it DOES have plenty of meat and fish protein), but the meat as well as the other ingredients more than make up for this. Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Formula with Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and Ocean Fish  also smells very fresh and not garbagey like some of the supermarket cat foods. And since Cee Cee is battling hyperthryoidism as well as a heart murmur, I want to buy her the best food I can afford. This may be a bit pricey but it is VERY dense, so it goes a long way."

674,1351209600,B0051COPH6,A3NDUBKYPI47N2,3,Product expiration & bulk ordering,"The product itself is pretty straight forward.  It's got pureed organic baby food in a little pouch.  Easier to transport than the little glass jars.  If your baby eats a lot, there's a lot more food per pouch.  The nozzle and cap makes it easy to squeeze straight onto a spoon and feed baby with no mess (at least on this end).  Also, since the food theoretically is being transferred from the pouch to the spoon, you don't have cross-contamination of the baby's mouth germs being reintroduced back into the jar of baby food.<br />The color of this particular product leaves a bit to be desired.  But the flavor was fine (to me) and the pear and garden greens combo is pretty nice and healthy.<br /><br />I echo the same concerns that another reviewer posted.  I actually got this product a little earlier since I knew my baby would be eating in a month or so.  Lo and behold, once I opened it when he was ready for solids, the expiration had already passed.  Perhaps this is only an issue for the free stuff we're getting through Vine reviews; I sure hope so.  But somebody ought to think twice about giving out stuff on the cusp of expiration that is meant for babies and their uniquely sensitive systems.  This is also relevant given that the baby food comes packaged as a pack of 12.  Now, I don't know who would buy a package of 12 food pouches of the *exact* same flavor.  Your baby must really love pear and greens.  Moreover, I mentioned that each pouch is 4.5 ounces.  That's more than 2 glass jars' worth.  My personal thought is that unless your child has texture issues or low oral muscle tone, the baby is probably going to move through the pureed food stage a lot faster than you could possibly go through 12 pouches of this baby food (I'm assuming that you're also providing him/her with other flavors, though).<br /><br />I also recommend looking into the Happy Baby brand of baby food.  It also comes in neat little pouches and has organic pureed fruits and veggie combos; but it adds additional Salba grains that are naturally rich in Omega-3s."
675,1351209600,B004P8FUXA,A18PSXOI64YFZC,3,its delicious...,I was surprised at how delicious these toasted chips are. They ship well with little damage. I have ordered them several times. Also they are very fresh. Not one bit was left in the bag when I got through.

Then Look No Further,"Holy cow, when I placed my order for 24 individual packets I assumed each packet would yield 1 gallon.  Wrong.  3 Quarts.  Apparently China Mist has taken a different course and screwed the customer out of that extra quart even though all the other brands that offer family size or filter pack tea bags the yield is always 1 gallon.<br />And now for the math...1 box 24 ct China Mist shipped = $35.45.  18 gallon yield = $1.96 per gallon.  Price per pound loose tea = $31.51.  NEVER AGAIN.  First and last purchase I make with China Mist of Arizona.  Especially when their product is mediocre at best anyway.  Give WALTERS BAY & COMPANY a try people.  They make 4 flavors of iced tea and their price which includes shipping and is prime eligible is $30.75 and that buys you 96 1.o oz filter packs...NINETY SIX GALLONS OF TEA.<br /><br />Enough said.  China Mist good riddance."
681,1351209600,B003IHO8OG,A21XO4RCPWMEVK,5,Gives Me The Focus I Need,"This past summer I started experimenting with products that claim to give you focus when I go to my pool games. The first one I tried was vitaminwater Attention which has caffeine in it. I initially like the results, but the next week I had taken a nap prior to drinking it and the caffeine became too overwhelming when I played my games and it caused me to rush a bit during my shots. It was my worst performance all summer long. For the last few months I've been drinking a neuro SONIC prior to my games and I LOVE IT! It gives me the focus I need without revving my engine up too much like the vitaminwater Attention did. I see a lot of people complaining about the price, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. Comparing it to the vitaminwater Attention it has A LOT more brain power ingredients, so it's not like they're overcharging you for nothing. They have a far superior product to any Monster or Red Bull or any other caffeine-loaded energy drinks on the market. And it gives you a lot more focus than 5 Hour Energy does as well. So the $2.50-$3.00 price tag is well worth it to me.<br /><br />I also like to mix this with a little sativa and the results are remarkable. I've been doing this combo all season long (started in September ends in December) and I'm the highest ranked player on my team. The best player on our team started the season off slow but he's been picking it up a bit lately so he might catch me by the end of the season. But if I keep up my winnings with the neuro SONIC & sativa combo I think I can keep my spot."
682,1351209600,B003Z2N8GI,A3G67CDWPI9HLA,4,Good value but still borderline junk-food,"I was very pleased to find these snacks at this price. The vending machines I'm around sometimes have these in them, but they're half the weight for basically the same price. I'll just keep a pack of these with me and get twice the value!<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars because they're not 100% fruit. Yes, they have real fruit juice in them, but they also have corn syrup (not high fructose thankfully), corn starch, and added sugar. These are good snacks, but they're still straddling the junk-food fence."

You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses ""...it's mostly water,"" our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the ""beef and liver"" chunks in the future."
689,1351209600,B000LKVL16,A2YRK0YLBN5CC2,3,"Good flavor, but a wet mess","I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

The safety latch is a nice feature that prevents accidental tripping while setting the trap. I don't follow the box instructions but rather set the traps on the surface.

In fact I've caught some after five or six days.  Picking the best tunnel is the hardest part of trapping moles so spent your time there rather than moving traps around every two days.

I highly recommend this to anyone with a dog who loves to chew and is looking for something other than a bone for them to chew on."

I've tried a handful of flavors since I've gotten my machine, and have been just ok with most of the flavors tried.  Fog Chaser has restored my faith in my investment!  Try this!  Coffee shop taste and at a better price than Keurig K Cups!"

I recently started using an inhaler which adds to my Dragon Breath, and this particular configuration, in the BLUE box gives relief. Bonus is it is sugar free!  I'm glad I was willing to spring for a product I'd not heard about. Now, I just have problems finding it easily, in local stores.  Hence, Amazon."

I did find, however, that it just wasn't full-bodied enough for me.  It left me wanting.  I can usually brew an 8 oz cup from my K-cups but truthfully even brewing at 6 oz I still didn't get the rich flavor I craved. So I've been finishing up the box by brewing it at 2 or 4 oz and adding a different K-cup brand to the mug.  I'd stir clear of this one."

I thought it was a little pricey but I re-use each stick at least once so that helps. I would buy again or suggest to others. Aa a matter of fact, I've given out 4 at work and everyone loves them!"
714,1351209600,B001NZPFB0,A3318V6FJ2KIII,5,My dog enjoys it and it helps her hips.,"My dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a 6-month old puppy.  The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.  I've tried various supplements and foods over the years and although she may sway a bit when walking and tire easily she's now 8 years old and we frequently go on short hikes together.<br /><br />I started feeding her Happy Hips about 4 months ago.  Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites."
715,1351209600,B001E52ZJ4,A34U0B84YB7FL2,5,Best of the Bunch,"Tastes great and full of fiber. The new breakfast of champions. Hard to find in the stores, especially this flavor. If you are a Prime member, the cost numbers work pretty well."

Volumizing - not only does it build up your hair at its roots, but also gives it volume to the end of your hair. Nourishing - if your hair tends to be dry - you will want to try this shampoo! My hair has never looked so good nor has it ever been this easy to manage!"
717,1351209600,B001L1MKLY,A38XYFHXEUNUW6,5,Yummy & Subtle,"Just made my first pot of this wonderful coffee. It was simply delish! Subtle hint of cinnamon. It wasn't overpowering, which I was worried about. I've had 2 cups already. I'll be making this lots! It's difficult to find flavored types of coffee that are decaf. Thumbs up! :-)"
718,1351209600,B001D09KAM,AEY5NHLOAWM21,3,The Kind Plus item was sticky,"I have no complaint about the product itself. I likely would have rated it very good had it not been subjected excessive heat somewhere along, before it arrived. Although I ate them, each one was sticking to the wrapper and<br />difficult to eat without sticky deposits on my face and hands."
719,1351209600,B000LKTTTW,A3GS4GWPIBV0NT,5,Very good,Wasnt sure about buying such a large quantity of something untried but it was great and we have went through it pretty quickly. Will buy again.
720,1351209600,B009BE2PGS,A2BOAFWDA691AF,4,Heavenly Decadence! But Oh MY!! The Calories...,"These Cookies are beyond tasty- They are heavenly & decadent! They have a cakelike texture with the perfect amount of pumpkin spices, and a cheesecake flavored white chip that completes the experience!  And, It is such a GOOD thing they are only available during the Holiday season (and I pray they keep it that way)or I'm telling you- I would be as big as the broadside of a barn.  That is no joke. Just one small cookie (approx. 1 oz with a 3"" diameter) contains a whopping 130 Calories, 4.5 grams of fat (2.5 saturated) and 21 grams of carbohydrates (12 of those sugar carbs).  So, just like everything else yummy in this world, this tasty tempation should be enjoyed in moderation. Thank you Pepperidge Farms for this tasty treat during the Holidays, and my waist, hips and behind would appreciate it if you keep it as a special Holiday only treat. :)"
721,1351209600,B005FH23QM,A3CGPHRA30C3WH,5,Belongs in your kitchen,"Grapeseed oil is a healthy, light oil of very mild but pleasing flavor. I use it when I don't want the strong flavor of olive oil or when I need an oil that will tolerate high temperature cooking. I don't use it every day, but I make sure there is always some in my kitchen when I need it. This seems to be a good brand."
722,1351209600,B005Y10XZ2,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,4,Surprisingly good!,"I was a little hesitant to try these bars, as I usually don't like chocolate for breakfast (I prefer fruit-flavored things in the morning).  However, what I DID like about these bars was the ""Protein Fit"" label; if I am going to grab a bar for breakfast, I want it to be high in protein rather than some sugary cereal bar.  These South Beach Protein Fit Bars have 9 grams protein (I usually look for 8 or more), 8 grams sugar (about 1 1/2 teaspoons--very reasonable), and 3.5 grams fat, with 2 of those being saturated (I don't worry overly about fat myself, but others might find the saturated fat content a bit on the high side).  The bars also contain a good dose of additional nutrition, with 3grams of fiber, 15% of the daily calcium requirement, and various other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of these bars as well.  Unlike many other chocolate products of this type, the chocolate tastes natural rather than artificial.  In additional, the bars have a very nice texture:  they are like a flaky, moist cereal bar.  Personally, I could have done without the extra drizzle of chocolate on top, but I think that chocolate lovers will truly love these bars.  I would definitely recommend the Chocolate Protein Fit bar to others; I plan to check out the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Y10YY2"">South Beach Protein Fit Cinnamon Raisin</a> flavor for myself."
723,1351209600,B005Y10XZ2,A235UFZGCFN3J5,5,Rich cocoa taste and satisfying...,"I like the convenience of protein bars for an on-the-go snack that fits in a purse or bag. I've been in search of a bar like this for a while because most other protein bars I've tried either aren't satisfying or have as many calories and fat as a big candy bar. These South Beach bars have a very rich cocoa flavor that chocolate lovers will appreciate. They're only 130 calories but still have a good amount of protein to keep hunger at bay between meals. They're also much lower in sugar than similar bars in this category but it doesn't affect the taste. They are just the right balance of low calorie, great taste and still very satisfying. I have already ordered my second box of these."
724,1351209600,B001E5E470,AGADB4E6N1EDS,5,Help for a Lousy Cook,"I'm a lousy cook and I know it.  However, when my kids and I grind a little garlic and red pepper over my otherwise bland food, it actually tastes good.  (It even makes my Thursday Night Spaghetti border on gourmet-ish when I also include a little fresh Parmesan.)  I've tried some other blends from our supermarket, but nothing else tastes as fresh or balanced as Drogheria & Alimentari.  It's not too hot for my youngest, (she's 8), but it has a enough kick for the rest of the clan.<br /><br />Having said that, a little of this goes a long way.  You might want to split an order with some friends to try it.  For our family, though, we like it so much we have it on our Subscribe and Save list."

She was delighted with the sentiment and the gluten free snacks!<br />When we ordered it, there was no place to put a gift greeting, so we contacted the company, and they added the greeting for us and were very sweet and courteous - we loved the customer service and the products.<br />We highly recommend this company and their products, delicious healthy snacks with great service.

731,1351209600,B0029NIBE8,A3RKYD8IUC5S0N,2,Messy and apparently undelicious,"My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone. It feels like saving money, but not if your cat is only gonna eat cornstarch gravy and turn her nose up at the meat by-products. It's probably fine for a grocery-store food, but a better quality food will make your cat happier and maybe healthier. Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits."
732,1351209600,B0042GSMLW,A1LOWH0EG7X3HR,5,Yummy,You can taste the butter.  The peanuts are fresh.  Each piece of See's Peanut Brittle is a nice size and the flavor is yummy.  If you are a prime member it ships at no additional charge.  Great deal!
733,1351209600,B007KPFSFA,A506HOOCVL8GW,5,BEST cup of coffee I've ever had!,"I thought I'd splurge and try this coffee.  It costs much more than other decaf K-Cup options.  But I hoped that meant it was better coffee.  It IS better coffee.  I've never had a better cup of coffee than this.  It is excellent when compared to any other decaf or regular coffee I've tried.<br /><br />If you like BOLD, FLAVORFUL decaf coffee try this coffee and you'll really like it."

737,1351209600,B005VOOT52,A2FKFQQPU498JT,5,chocolate heaven,Excellent smooth taste. Any one who loves chocolate will enjoy this drink. Almost has good as International house's dark mayan chocolate coffee was.

739,1351209600,B0050B1GS4,A245UUHQOLXF6L,3,Tricky to work with,"This product is very tricky to work with and a pain in the rear.  If you can get it cut and on the cake without tearing, it looks great, but it's very delicate work.  Buy 2 the first time you use it, because you will probably need a backup.  I cut out a VERY simple silhouette of a black cat to go on top of an orange Halloween cake and even that simple shape had to be trimmed and finessed because the edges would tear as I was cutting (I used small sharp cuticle scissors).  If you have a Cricut and lots of shapes to cut with, it's probably a lot easier, but I don't anticipate using these enough to justify the expense.  Cool concept- but I think it would work much better if the sheets were a little thicker and sturdier.<br /><br />ALSO- the black will stain your fingers and your tongue (!) when you eat it.  Kids thought it was great, hubby and me not so much.<br /><br />By the way, I DON'T recommend the pre-cut letter sheets.  The letters are small and not very well cut.  I couldn't get them off the backing without tearing them- I ended up having to pipe the letters on anyway, which I could have done in the first place much more quickly and easily.  Not worth the $4-$5."
740,1351209600,B00866AM2G,ADTOX2JFWWA0B,5,Love it.,I love this but think its a little to expensive for everyday use. It's refreshing and really quenches your thirst.

We have experimented, using the same roasted beans with different water sources. We have learned that the beans alone do not make the coffee. The WATER that is used also plays an important part of how your coffee tastes. Try your tap water one morning and spring water the next morning, using the same beans! SURPRISE !"
744,1351209600,B005J0N5ZI,AK42RQFIGJAEJ,5,OMG!!!,"I just want to start off by saying that I am a holiday fanatic!! I love the smells like the heater kicking on for the first time in the fall, the onions/celery/bell pepper being cooked up for stuffing, etc. My family has been big Pennsylvania Dutch Egg Nog drinkers. Love the stuff and love that it's cheap (BIG family). I spent the holidays with my in-laws in the northeast and had this stuff for the first time. From then on, I was hooked!! You have to like egg nog of course, but the fact that it's chocolate too is even better. Very creamy, but not too thick like some other brands can be. The only drawback is I can't find the stuff where I live so I have to ship it in, which turns out to be pretty expensive in shipping costs especially since the product is usually less than $10 a bottle! I would recommend this to every egg nog lover!!"

It is sometimes difficult to find at local gracery stores and specility coffee stores are far too expensive.  It makes great expresso and excellent caffe' latte. The price on Amazon is excellent.  I buy it in a pack of six and price is even better.
750,1351209600,B001ELL9GI,AJB0B4DIL1292,5,a great product and deal,"I looked at all of the reviews and shopped around locally before buying these.  Locally the best deal I could find was $6 for 1 oz!!!!! I use them on my cereal, yogurt, granola and even in baking. They are yummy and very good for you. I shared one bag with my two health conscious kids and put the other bag in the freezer so I can dip into as needed.  You will not regret buying these.  I tried roasting some but prefer the nibs in their natural state.  I plan to grind some up and try in place of cocoa powder in recipes."

I don't think my normally voracious cat loved this product though; she would often take a few bites, then walk away from it, then come back to it only when she became very hungry. Of course, this is only one case, and I have no explanation--the ingredients seem to be good and it didn't smell or look particularly offensive."

I was hoping it would make a good cup of coffee like the AeroPress does but there is no comparison... and the AeroPress also cleans up much easier. If you are looking for a great cup of coffee...look elsewhere. If you don't have a Keurig machine and want a inexpensive way to use K-Cups then you may be satisfied.

758,1351209600,B007OXHJX2,A2PJ4OL92XGPHY,5,Whole Grain Food for great Health Benefit,I love the taste and ease of cooking this rice.  The reason for making the purchase was because of the fact that is is a whole grain food item with a great deal of health benefits.  Made the puchase for a diabetic because it is a low glycemic food item.<br /><br />I must say that everyone who I have shared the Black Rice with enjoyed it the most when it was cooked in a broth.<br /><br />I like the texture and taste with or without broth.  I must say that the health benefits of the rice is what I was seeking and have found in this rice.  Worth every penny that I spent on it.

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

It has a similar nutty flavor, with a great contrast of salty and sweet. The shipping was fast, and its a delicious and healthy snack you can eat with just about anything!"

They left the box in front of my garage door in the middle of the driveway. Because of this odd delivery location, my wife ran over the box when she backed out of the garage and did not see the box.  we lost half of the cups.  Thius is the third time I have written about this matter to Amazon with no results.  Hopefully someone will respond to me.<br /><br />fred santaniello"

I loved it so much I wanted to find it to buy for myself and keep it around.  I always look on Amazon because you can find everything here and true enough, I found this wonderful candy.  It is nice to keep in your purse for when you are out and about and get a dry throat or a tickle in the back of your throat.  It is also nice to have in a candy dish at home for guests to try."

You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.

We like this, but it's definitely an acquired taste.<br />- Separates if too much liquid is added so you can't make thin hotcakes or crispy light waffles with this mix.<br />- The boxes are tiny, a lot of product goes a little way.

It is indeed very tasty, but I have to knock off a star for the flimsy lid. I flipped it open to try the syrup for the first time and half the hinge broke.

They best compliment is when the kids ask, can we make another batch, and they like it better than the movie.  Our friends have tried it and have asked for what we use as our popcorn recipe.  How cool is that!?"

798,1351209600,B000ILEITA,A2CYN807KI4S4,5,"Blue Dog Bakery Natural Low Fat Dog Treats, Assorted Flavors","My dog loves these treats and I love the fact that they are natural and low fat.  I did have difficulty getting them though.  The USPS completely dropped the ball on this.  The first order they lost and couldn't/wouldn't find until Amazon called them.  Then they miraculously found them and said that they would deliver within a week.  That was two weeks into a guaranted 2-day delivery.  I reordered and got the new order in before the scheduled delivery date.  Well, the scheduled delivery date came and went with no dog treats and no call from the USPS.  Amazon did reimburse me for the first order though.  In summary...treats good...USPS...sucks!  Is there any alternative shipping methods available?"

I received an email back from Starbucks that my order had been canceled. No explanation at all, just that it had been canceled. I checked back on Amazon and see that this item is still available but they had raised the price.<br /><br />So instead of honoring the price they just blew me off like the sale never happened.  Shame on Amazon for allowing a seller to do this.<br /><br />Bottom line, Amazon has gone down a few points in my eyes.  Greedy Starbucks can keep their coffee."

801,1351209600,B0079OTURE,ANSBPV2CZVZ39,5,I love the powdered xylitol,"even though this stuff is higher in price and I wished i could afford the powdered all the time, this is great for in my coffee or drinks to sweeten. when baking with xylitol though, it can be a little too much. xylitol will loosen your stools, give you gas and other things. the more your body gets use to it..the more you can eat. so I mix in some other sweetener like organic agave inulin powder (not the liquid, its full of sugar). It will definitely give you gas but no other side effects."

804,1351209600,B001A5VLYS,AMPYE406UY34Y,5,Love It,"First let me say I'm new to drinking tea. So you're not getting a well rounded expert opinion. I started drinking lipton green tea at work and loved it. Small caffeine boost, great flavor, no calories, etc. Read about white teas online so I gave this a try. The price is incredible. The tea reminds me of a tea I drank at a Chinese restaurant when I was young. Brings back good childhood memories, love the flavor. WILL BUY AGAIN."
805,1351209600,B007TGDXMK,A1BSGNCHEI1PJI,5,Very Nice Medium Roast,"This coffee has the best aroma!  Great medium taste.  I have replaced our Starbucks Pike's Peak Roast because my husband and I like the taste better.  I store it in a sealed container, don't mind that I can't store it in my drawer with the other k-cups.  The overall morning experience is pleasant!"
806,1351209600,B00529PECI,A3H4L7TJKQHW4Q,2,One of the better one's,"I tried one stick of this, and two other flavors.  This salmon is so tough that when you break it in half, if forms razor sharp ends.  It is very very salty and not all that great in my opinion.  I am used to King salmon being very juicy and oily.  I understand this is jerky, but it is to tough to chew."

When buying these particular mixes here in bulk of 6 boxes they came out to be so much cheaper than buying them in my stores in my area. So delicious sweet treat and cheaper price is a steal!!! The Chocolate cake mix and brownie mix are definately NOT cheaper to puchase this way here for some reason.
811,1351209600,B00523NRVO,A2JDXKFZ0PFHKU,5,The perfect pop!,"These lollipops are are well done, look exactly like the picture. Not a single one was broken! They packaged each lollipop so nicely, very impressed!"

813,1351209600,B001EQ5IAG,A225UWT247BBBH,5,Great stuff! No aftertaste.,"I made sugar-free merengues with this sweetener and they turned out beautifully. This sweetener does have a cooling effect on the tongue just like peppermint, so you will either need to use it in combination with another sweetener, or plan for this effect (I used peppermint flavoring, so it was fine).  In heavier baked goods with more ingredients, this isn't a problem, but frosting/icings and merengues can't cover it up.<br /><br />I've also used it to make carb-free flaxmeal cornbread and chocolate cake, and it is amazing. No funky aftertaste like splenda, equal, and sweet n'low.  The cooling effect is undetectable in the more complex recipes."
814,1351209600,B000SMN0DO,AHAJ5BRYBP7U2,5,This stuff is awesome!,"Dandy Blend is awesome! Why drink coffee when you can drink Dandy Blend? Coffee has lots of things in it that are bad for you (check the web), even though people don't like to admit it. Dandy Blend is a liver cleanser and it tastes great. You can drink it hot or cold. I usually drink it hot and add a little rice milk to it to give it that creamy taste. Mmm, yum. I think I'll go drink a cup right now. It is so much better than all of the ""coffee substitutes"" out there. (I've tried them all.)"
815,1351209600,B00018CWN4,A37264CFSSA73O,5,Great quality!,"This product is very good and I won't change it for any other brand nor vendor.<br />It made my ""chipas"" taste delicious."

817,1351209600,B006N0KV8W,A1OA7ZKRQH98C8,5,no complaints,"I'm a huge fan of Jack Daniel's jelly, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016268C"">Historic Lychburg Tennessee Whiskey Burgundy Grape Jelly</a>, so I definitely wanted to try this.  I love how you can get four different flavors instead of a four-pack of the same thing, so this is a good buy.<br /><br />I prefer the Spicy Original and the Original No. 7 Recipe, as I like my sauces to have more of a bite instead of a sweetness, which the Hickory Brown Sugar and the Honey Smokehouse versions have.  So if you like sweet sauces, you're also covered here.<br /><br />I put the Spicy Original on my mashed potatoes and Original No. 7 Recipe on ham, so you're not limited to pulled pork or ribs.  But I used to live in Memphis, where I would eat barbeque pizza and barbeque spaghetti.<br /><br />Overall, I don't consider this expensive for what you get, and I'm pleased with the quality of the product.  Now if I could get the jelly at a reasonable price without having to go to Lynchburg, I'd be good to go."

820,1351209600,B000BRR8VQ,A1HHNY1GVD3UIS,5,my dogs love the peanut butter!,"First off, read the ingredients, no crazy words I can't pronounce, which means it's all natural! I got the peanut butter treats for my two children: husky/shepherd and a lab/shepherd mix, and they can't get enough of them. Plus, on Amazon, this is such a great value for 16oz. Beats petsmart for sure! I'll be looking for more Zuke's products now that I've discovered them. Thanks Zuke's!"
821,1351209600,B003ASXKV0,AUEA2NJHMK9DF,4,Like this tea,This tea has a nice flavor although I wish it was a little stronger.  I have brewed way it states and even tried letting it sit longer  to get a stronger cup but it didn't work.  Am pleased with purchase and flavor overall.
822,1351209600,B005K4Q1RW,A2TZKSY1ZWPOU9,5,Great Hot Cider!!!,It is hard to find much of anything sugarfree that really tastes good but this apple cider is the best.  I also love the regular hot apple cider in sugarfree form.

826,1351209600,B003OFNR6M,A27LEUWQ49OTWX,2,"Poor germination rate, poor growth","I have tried to grow these in little starter plugs and I sowed directly onto a soil.  Both times germination rate was very poor.  Transplants died.  Direct sowing was a bit better but those geraniums were growing very measly.  I planted them in very good soil (I test all my soil annually) all other things grown in that soil were great!  I would give it 1 star, but give it a benefit of a doubt as I might have not know how to properly grow these geraniums."
827,1351209600,B002ESVRWQ,A293T21WVQ3TDC,2,A bit weak...,"The coffee ""Blend"" is really lean on Kona and really fat on fill. I could not get a full bodied taste no matter how I ground it. If you want real Kona taste, spend the bucks and buy real Kona!!!"
828,1351209600,B000EIE20M,A39QHSDUBR8L0T,3,Just ok,I bought this brand because it was all they had at Ranch 99 near us. I find it spicy (hot) but not enough flavor. I would have rather bought Maesri Thai Green Curry Paste. It is much much more flavorful and spicy.
829,1351209600,B000EMAZK4,A46U02M3QK02,5,FAVORITE tea...,Lipton makes the BEST French Vanilla tea...I have tried others and this is my favorite.  Just the right balance in the vanilla flavoring.  I buy it by the case as it is hard to find in stores - thankful Amazon is carrying.  LOVE this tea!
830,1351209600,B0032CJPOK,A2NJAE2OHSSFA7,5,Best formula on the market,"I have tried pretty much every formula on the market, from similac to enfamil, and this is by far the best.  It settles well with my baby's tummy and she doesn't have any digestive problems.  It's worth the extra money."
831,1351209600,B0014X5O1C,AHYRTWABDAG1H,5,Wonderful alternative to soda pop,"This is a wonderful alternative to soda pop.  It's carbonated for those like me that just enjoy fizzy drinks way too much for their own good, yet it also contains 70 percent total juice.  I'm not going to say it should be a substitute to drinking normal fruit juice, but if again you're like me, and both are almost addicted to fizzy drinks and can't stand the taste of any artificial sweetner to even try to gag down a ""diet"" soda, then this is very much the way to go.  I also do suggest this flavor, most or all of the Izze line uses some of the flavor of juice listed on the can, but also some grape and/or apple juice as a ""filler"".  They do the same here, but it tastes first like clementine or at least orange juice, and then a hint of the others come through.  I've found with most other flavors of Izze it will taste more like the ""filler"" first, and then the flavor listed on the can or bottle.<br /><br />Price may seem high, but compared to what a 4 pack costs here it's actually not horrid considering.  And if one has an amazon prime account, then shipping costs aren't a major issue."
832,1351209600,B001PHVO5W,A20RGALDT1UMYG,1,way too bitter,"I love coffee. I am used to strong coffee, I have lots of it. I drink espresso with no sugar or milk. But strong coffee doesn't have to be this bitter. My stomach hurts from drinking it."

834,1351209600,B000S859NC,A2H7STZ2URUCOE,5,GREAT TEA,"Rooibos Natural Red tea is something of a personal taste! It has an interesting flavor as all things that are good for you do! I prefer to add a little cinnamon to mine. It is known to be used for people who get GOUT and since I do , I have had no incidents since drinking this tea! If it works, use it! It is a good tea and caffeine free. Some prefer it with sugar!Give it a try too for it's calming effect!"
835,1351209600,B004NB7A1O,A2JDXKFZ0PFHKU,5,Perfect pops!,Not a single pop arrived broken! They take a lot of time in the packaging of this product and it is much appreciated.
836,1351209600,B000EML7DS,A2DFSA2JXQKVY3,4,Not bad.,"These are small and very salty. The taste is good, but very strong, so it's a good thing the package contains a small amount. It only takes a few little crisps to cure my salty/crunchy craving. I can snack on one package for an entire day. Of course these would not be a good snack if you're very hungry, because there isn't enough there to fill you up. For less than $1 per pack it's an okay deal."
837,1351209600,B008RRJCDY,A1W6E1FN0745L7,5,Great Choice on Popcorn,"This powder is unlike anything I've had with its unique flavors.  It's a mildly sweet, tangy flavor which goes fantastic on popcorn.  While I think most of us love hot, buttered popcorn with an ample amount of salt the simple fact is it's not very healthy.  So, I was on a search to find something which was flavorful on air-popped popcorn, but not too bad nutritionally.  This fits the bill."
838,1351209600,B0009P5Y9I,A5R3XOLGJG1P5,5,Love this!,"The pods are easy to use and have a wonderful aroma when released from their foil packets.  The crema is perfect every time.  Smooth enough to drink solo, and strong enough to still have a presence when used for lattes or cappuccino."
839,1351209600,B004MMNNDS,A248RO4GSIWDII,5,Love it!,"Heard great things about drinking this tea. I was very happy with the purchase from this vendor, and I need to reorder ASAP."
840,1351209600,B0002NVKZ4,A94YB71KEDA3X,5,Our pantry staple!,"I first tried these last year and absolutely fell in love. The only fresh mushrooms we can get here are the very basics so to add these is heavenly.<br /><br />Soups, stews, egg dishes, gravies, meatloaf, these mushrooms make just about everything taste better!<br /><br />And it's so easy. I rinse them quickly before letting them soak as I'm a bit lazy and didn't want to filter the liquid as they recommend on their website. I've never had any problem. I use the liquid as well, and if I don't use it in that recipe, I save it for another! It's that good!<br /><br />I cheat and use my Keurig to soak them in a 4 cup vessel with 2 of the large size cups. Perfect every time. I usually grab two very large handfuls of the porcinis to reconstitute.<br /><br />Beware:<br />I accidentally ordered from the wrong vendor a few days ago and got a huge bag of... literally - garbage. It smelled so odd, was discolored (dyed?) and just gross. I can only think it was the victim of some warehouse flood or something. Amazon refunded my money and I ordered from here again and just got the most fragrant, delicious mushrooms. I'll never make that mistake again!<br /><br />Please enjoy these - they are wonderful and I'm so glad I can get them from Amazon!"
841,1351209600,B008AHJZWY,AL0PVH6QPNWMW,1,Hint Fizz,I love hint water so when I saw they offered hint fizz I had to try it. It is the worst thing I have ever tasted. Straight soda water with absolutely no HINT of watermelon. I wrote to the company regarding any form of customer satisfaction guarantee and as of now I have not heard from them.  This has been 2 weeks now.
842,1351209600,B003X0RV7O,A3T6IV5D8PTPIZ,5,Just like the Restaurant...,This is great tasting tea! It tastes just like the tea at the restaurant where we were first turned on to Genmai-cha! Nothing negative to say.

844,1351209600,B000EMAZK4,A20DY4XPIV6YKR,5,SO GOOD!!!,"I love this French Vanilla tea and it's not available in stores any longer so I was THRILLED to find it on Amazon. Now that the weather has turned cool, it's time for tea!!"
845,1351209600,B002YHU9LC,A2Z0XFW79HXASE,5,Yum,"Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum...  (Munch, munch).  Yum!  Love it and it tastes wonderful.  Works perfect in a whirly-popcorn maker.  They best compliment is when the kids ask, can we make another batch, and they like it better than the movie.  Our friends have tried it and have asked for what we use as our popcorn recipe.  How cool is that!?"
846,1351209600,B00791V0S4,A3SCMZEAXS6VEQ,5,Perfect Snack,"I purchased this item because it was reviewed so highly on another web site.  It didn't disappoint.  It's not overly sweet, which is perfect. I've compared the taste to less sweet cross between a fig newton and bit of a granola bar. Great for traveling when you don't have access to healthy snacks."
847,1351209600,B005BD7WFC,A2MBKP24AYSXX2,5,Tasty!,"I wish these came in larger quantities, if I could have a cuppa everyday I would. So refreshing and tasty!"
848,1351209600,B000C08B0E,AUEA2NJHMK9DF,4,Like this tea,This tea has a nice flavor although I wish it was a little stronger.  I have brewed way it states and even tried letting it sit longer  to get a stronger cup but it didn't work.  Am pleased with purchase and flavor overall.

850,1351209600,B0029NU31M,A1HKHIP6VCMALP,3,Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough,"When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses ""...it's mostly water,"" our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the ""beef and liver"" chunks in the future."

852,1351209600,B000I6MCSY,AO34Q3JGZU0JQ,5,Just My Kind of Coffee,"Coffee Masters Hazelnut coffee used to be carried in a local coffee/pastry shop, which is where I fell in love with it.  Then they went out of business and I tried for so long to locate it elsewhere, finally finding it at Amazon.  It is a mild coffee with a lovely flavor and aroma.  I used to mix it half and half with regular coffee, but now drink it 100% by itself 100% of the time.  Got on the auto ship plan and couldn't be happier."
853,1351209600,B001IZM7QQ,A2FWY7OWLFDRT3,5,sooo good,tastes so good. Worth the money. My boyfriend hates wheat pasta and LOVES this. cooks fast tastes great.I love this brand and started buying more of their pastas. Bulk is best.
854,1351209600,B001NZTESU,A3318V6FJ2KIII,5,My dog enjoys it and it helps her hips.,"My dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a 6-month old puppy.  The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.  I've tried various supplements and foods over the years and although she may sway a bit when walking and tire easily she's now 8 years old and we frequently go on short hikes together.<br /><br />I started feeding her Happy Hips about 4 months ago.  Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites."
855,1351209600,B000S6CCJ8,A3RI8KFE0MW24F,5,Very pleased,Bought this as a gift for our daughter in law.  She was very pleased.  So that makes us very pleased.  Nice gift.

858,1351209600,B000H0ZJHW,A1HHNY1GVD3UIS,5,my dogs love the peanut butter!,"First off, read the ingredients, no crazy words I can't pronounce, which means it's all natural! I got the peanut butter treats for my two children: husky/shepherd and a lab/shepherd mix, and they can't get enough of them. Plus, on Amazon, this is such a great value for 16oz. Beats petsmart for sure! I'll be looking for more Zuke's products now that I've discovered them. Thanks Zuke's!"
859,1351209600,B004281MKI,A1LOWH0EG7X3HR,5,Yummy,You can taste the butter.  The peanuts are fresh.  Each piece of See's Peanut Brittle is a nice size and the flavor is yummy.  If you are a prime member it ships at no additional charge.  Great deal!

It's thinner than most creamy Italian dressings but it helps coat the salad evenly without overdressing it.  Rated 5 stars not because it is the most delicious salad dressing I have ever had, but because it tastes exactly as you would hope.<br /><br />This dressing can also be purchased directly from Olive Garden restaurants."

Not only is this a great coffee overall, but even compared to other Sumatran coffees and Sumatran blends this one can hold it's own against most other roasters. I enjoy it better than both the Sumatran offerings from Starbucks. I would say it is right on par with the caribou Sumatran product. only ones that I have enjoyed even a little more were products from  Cats Ass Coffee harvested from animal droppings (Kopi luwak)at over $150 a pound 0.o and the Sumatran offered by S&D... But the S&D product is hard to find or discontinued/seasonal. I would tell friends and Coffee people all over to try this! (And yes, I grew up in Portland and Seattle so I just may know better than you)  :P  LoL<br /><br />Enjoy!"

864,1351209600,B0015R9BQG,A2YRK0YLBN5CC2,3,"Good flavor, but a wet mess","I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."
865,1351209600,B007F1MA46,A1LHOKYENR7HP2,5,Vinegar Is Magic!,"I have always heard about vinegar being great for cleaning, I'm sure I even used it to clean a microwave before, and I know I've soaked mildew-smelling clothes in vinegar water which was successful. But, it wasn't until I bought a steam mop (here on Amazon) and tackled my vinyl kitchen floors, that hadn't been well cleaned in years... that I discovered the MAGIC of vinegar. This steam mop left my floor so tacky and sticky, if I stood in one place, I felt like either the floor or my skin was going to come off. I took to the internet for a solution. Someone said to mop the floor with vinegar. Skeptical, but desperate, I did ONE mopping of the vinegar all over the kitchen floor. Just like that, as soon as it dried my floor was clean again. Extremely excited, I looked up more magic ways vinegar cleans. Then I ran out of vinegar, and had to buy some more. I have used it now to clean faux wood blinds that had grease & dust buildup, air return vent that had years of residue & dust build up, and stained toilets. I now keep a generic spray bottle of vinegar for cleaning anything.<br />Alright, I am a believer now. Vinegar is magic."

Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Habanero Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite.  Its flavor is novel and peculiar but not to my liking.  It also has a strong heat, but that is understandable since it is a habanero sauce, but it is still too hot for my liking.  I did use the entire bottle of it, though, and tried it on several food items.  Even though I am glad that I tried this hot sauce, it is not pleasing to me."

So much better than a Starbucks Pumpkin Latte (which we find too sweet, if we're stuck getting one we do only 2 pumps, not the Starbucks standard 4). Subtle pumpkin with spice elements of cinnamon and cardamon. Looking forward to trying their other products. Didn't know they also make olive oils and martini mixes."

When I was a kid, this chili was downright tasty and meaty, and you could add a can of beans to stretch it out, just let the chili and beans simmer for a while and you had the perfect recipe. However, that recipe has changed. There is considerably less meat in here, and what has it been replaced with? Oatmeal. This even says so on the side. I am sorry, but I am disappointed. If I want oatmeal, I'll buy Quaker. This chili is also thinner, and does not taste as good as it has before. If Hormel would go back to the old recipe, this chili would be as good as ever."

It very well may be the placebo effect but then again the effects are going to be subtle unlike energy drinks which kick you in the face and leave you jittery and wired. Its vitamins, nutrients, amino acids and such, it's not going to wash over you like warm wave of happiness, but it will subtly and pleasantly leave you feeling good (and with the sonic; productive).  And no I have no affiliation with nuero and heard about this from a friend who bought it locally."

889,1351209600,B0012KB4U2,AGQBI6601XH2R,5,Both cats love these!,They only like this brand and flavor of treat.  Won't go for the soft version.  One of my cats will actually stick his paw down into the canister and drag a few up the side if I hold the can within reach.  I find this product reasonably priced at Target.
890,1351209600,B0027E0XGS,AKKQ4GKRGROGG,5,mint julips,"The syrup I got from Oak Alley Plantation for making my own mint julips was so helpful in recreating the drink I had while at Oak Alley Plantation in Vacherie, LA drinking a mint julip on the verranda of the plantation...it made it taste as good as theirs was.  It came  tightly packed so as not to break and I always feel like I am back there on the verranda when I have a mint julip."
891,1351209600,B0029O6YK0,A3RKYD8IUC5S0N,2,Messy and apparently undelicious,"My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone. It feels like saving money, but not if your cat is only gonna eat cornstarch gravy and turn her nose up at the meat by-products. It's probably fine for a grocery-store food, but a better quality food will make your cat happier and maybe healthier. Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits."
892,1351209600,B003P9XFTG,A1X4OJBDP7HMTZ,2,Blue Buffalo Wilderness,"Very disappointed with this product. I've read so many positive reviews and opted to purchase a bag of this pricey food as a treat for my eight cats.<br /><br />l. Didn't make sure shipping was free under my ""Amazon Prime"" and ended up paying $6.00 and some change.<br /><br />2. NONE of the eight cats like it. They sniff it and walk away. Even the half feral one won't chow down on it.<br /><br />Overall, a total waste of money. Guess the possums will eat it."
893,1351209600,B008YA1NWC,A2O4V3MCB7EPPU,4,One of my favorite K-cups flavors,This is one of my favorite k-cup flavors.  The coffee roast is mild and has just the right amount of coconut flavor. It is not over powering or cloying.  I like to brew this on the second to largest size setting (on my machine) and add one splenda and liquid carmel creamer.  It sounds like a weird combo but it's really good.  It's my Saturday morning go to coffee combo.

896,1351209600,B002QZ3XKG,A18PSXOI64YFZC,3,its delicious...,I was surprised at how delicious these toasted chips are. They ship well with little damage. I have ordered them several times. Also they are very fresh. Not one bit was left in the bag when I got through.
897,1351209600,B000MBN5TK,A1W2QH1LI4YQR4,5,Yum!,"I'll never go back to regular taco seasoning again!  I use this for tacos, taco salad, and I've heard it's even good in chili--though I haven't had a chance to try that yet.  This seasoning does not rely on chili powder for the main flavoring and is a refreshing change from the same ol' same ol' taco seasonings."
898,1351209600,B004WZ4EW4,A2IQ7EI0PHDE8J,2,Tasty but not truly raw,"These taste great and it's nice to see they've come out with some naked seaweed without anything added.  However...I've had raw seaweed before, and I seriously doubt this is raw.  It is crunchy which probably means it's been processed at high heat, which is also common for many products that claim to be raw.  Truly raw seaweed has a crispness to it but is still fairly chewy and more difficult to break apart. I read the label and it says nothing about what temperature it is processed  (other companies who manufacture raw items typically provide this information).  I knew I bought it at my own risk, and am disappointed since I like this company."

I did not like the taste of the Martinson product at all.  I threw it away, not the product I expected at all.  The Brown Gold was more palatable, however certain flavors with this brand also feel short in particular the Costa Rican named product was extremely too bitter.  I would agree with most that this does give you a lower cost per serving, but when the coffee is inferior and the taste match is also, I think the best descriptor is cheap."
902,1351209600,B000F4D5GC,A13P5PAZMA5ENT,5,Good buy,"I have been using lots of coconut lately in granola, cakes, cup cakes etc. and this particular brand serves my purpose very well.<br />The price is very good."

When I saw it on Amazon, I had to try it. It lived up to all that I had heard. I could not stop eating it! I have recommended it to many others. It makes a good gift for friends or co-workers or a special little treat for yourself."
908,1351209600,B000CR41MO,A3FH318GY52DC7,5,Best I've Ever Had,"I have eaten all kinds of popcorn for many years.  Many years ago, we made popcorn the old fashioned way; in a pot on the stove.  I remember it being crisp and crunchy.  Then, along came microwave popcorn.  I tried many different brands and none of them had the same crisp, and sometimes they were just plain mushy. I thought this was just a common attribute among microwavable popcorn products until several years ago when I tried making it the old fashioned way with the same results.<br /><br />What I have come to realize is, it's not how you prepare the popcorn, it's whether or not it's ""organic.""  The first time I tried ""Newman's Own,"" it had that crisp and crunchy texture that I remembered from so many years ago.  Perfect!"
909,1351209600,B000LKXJEI,A2YRK0YLBN5CC2,3,"Good flavor, but a wet mess","I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

I'm not a baker too so give me a break:) Anyway, this is definitely growing on me, I had my second piece today, I bought the little pkg of 10 individually wrapped squares. It is very good and you definitely should let it melt in your mouth and savor the flavor, like another reviewer stated "" like a glass of wine""  I will definitely be buying more of this.

I enjoy it better than both the Sumatran offerings from Starbucks. I would say it is right on par with the caribou Sumatran product. only ones that I have enjoyed even a little more were products from  Cats Ass Coffee harvested from animal droppings (Kopi luwak)at over $150 a pound 0.o and the Sumatran offered by S&D...

I had to have something, so I bought Konriko's. And I've never gone back.  I now have to order it online at unheard of prices because the grocery store no longer carries it, but I do so because it really is the best. It's the perfect blend of salt, spiciness, and FLAVOR. I've tried other cajun and creole seasonings that were saltier or hotter (or both--I'm talking to you, Tony Chachere's More Spice!), but none were tastier. Makes the best blackened chicken."

But I definitely did not think that the flavor was particularly French Vanilla, even with French Vanilla creamer.

Additionally, when I tried to return the products, the site informed me tht they ewere not returnable (Even the unopened packages)."
953,1351209600,B000LKU3A6,A2YRK0YLBN5CC2,3,"Good flavor, but a wet mess","I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."
954,1351209600,B008JA73RG,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,4,Neither too sweet nor fizzy,"V8 V-Fusion may appear to be the typical energy drink that is available today, but the difference between V8 and drinks such as Red Bull, this drink contains vegetable and fruit and 50 calories.  This may be a nice alternative to carbonated sodas or sugary fruit juices because it contains nutritional ingredients that may provide a bit of energy for the day.  The drink contains fruity peach mango flavor, green tea, and vitamin B, but also a concentration of potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and carrots.<br /><br />With the natural energy that V8 V-Fusion provides, one may want to switch from the regular cup of coffee or fizzy pop that usually contains the energy for the day.  The taste is satisfying, not too sweet, fruity, acidic, or watery.  And after trying the 8 fl. Oz. Can, one may not be enough, however, the contents warn that it may not be recommended for children, women nursing or pregnant, or individuals watching their caffeine in take.  But one recommendation, chill the drink before serving."
955,1351209600,B000MUT928,AMV75AVRSNM0L,3,Crunchy strong and ok taste,"I thought the pocket coffee was good, not sure I'll order them again though.  It definitely has a coffee flavor and is a strong flavor, has a little bit of a crunch to it, but it's also has a bitter after taste which might be reason it's not what I expected."
956,1351209600,B0007PNKRS,A1TED4G0PWZPQV,5,Came as expected,It was tasty and fresh. The other one I bought was old and tasted moldy. But this one was good.
957,1351209600,B0006349WQ,A21BT40VZCCYT4,5,Good Training Treat,My dog will come in from outside when I am training her and look at the cupboard waiting for her treat. When I use the clicker training method she comes because she knows she has something special.
958,1351209600,B001ANXL84,A3NZ74QTATJ45W,5,Best electrolyte replacement drink,"I'm a disabled Vet with 80% of my kidneys gone. I'm on heavy water pills that deplete my essensil fluids. Cramping is my worst result. I started drinking Vitalyte, a glass four times a day and the cramps are gone! I sleep all night without having to get up and walk off leg and foot cramps. This is the greatest stuff I have ever tried. Makes Gatorade and the other 'kid' stuff a waste of my time and money.<br /><br />  When a physcial therapist told me about 'Gookinaid' I thought he was pulling my leg. But I bought it and tried it and I'm sold. I buy anywhere from 4 to 6 tubs a month. I fill water bottles and carry them in my car for trips. My wife even drinks it and has felt the great affects. If you have cramping or feel a bit run down, give this a try it does wonders. Our favorite flavors are Orange and Grape. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."

961,1351209600,B000LKYRXK,A2WVF9ZQ068DN0,5,TERRIFIC multigrain for baking,"Although I first purchased this cereal to use as a hot cereal, I do not care for the mushy texture of the cereal.  The taste, however, is TERRIFIC.  The cannister included a recipe for muffins made with the mix.  I tried them and they were TERRRIFIC.  I then went on to make a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies using the multigrain cereal instead of oats. They were TERRIFIC.  Moving right along through my recipe box I added some of the multigrain cereal to a pumpkin bread recipe.  Can you guess?  It was TERRIFIC.  Lasly, I may not enjoy eating this cereal solo, but I find using half steel cut oats and half multigrain cereal makes a TERRIFIC porridge.<br />In looking at others reviews I see that most people love this as a cereal.  Texture is a personal preference and I think people who enjoy creamier cereals will enjoy this as well."
962,1351209600,B007TJGZ5E,A3UOYYQS5Z47MS,5,Morning Coffee,Great coffee at a good price. I'm a subscription buyer and I buy this month after month. What more can I say?
963,1351209600,B000O3KMKG,AAB6ZMWFCK4GO,5,Excellent,The Premium Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Vannila Beans were exactly as described in the ad.  They arrived promptly and I have made my first batch of homemade French Vanilla Creamer with them.  They are wonderful.
964,1351209600,B000P07YA4,AVN9NG27SPISS,1,New Recipe is Awful,"These used to be my favorite animal crackers but Austin has recently changed their recipe to a ""new and improved"" version and as a result, what was once a tasty snack now tastes like cardboard.  The old version had a hint of lemon and the new version is completely tasteless and leaves a horrible after-taste in your mouth.  Nice going Austin.  Won't purchase again.  Austin needs to take a lesson from previous companies that tried to change what was already good and go back to the original."
965,1351209600,B003KLT05C,A36SZQV6KFCY6B,5,great healthy and yummy i love love love,"these crackers are delicious . i absolutely love them. my dr is a runner ,very healthy man. i took some in and gave him a box and he loved them. he also told me they were very healty. im a diabetic and they are low in carbs and very healthy-just a yummy treat"
966,1351209600,B007TGO1TY,A1N655X9X7C6QY,4,Its LIGHT but very nice sweetener,"This Nectresse Sweetener is rather light in taste --but is very nice over other light foods such as fruits , berries , melons -----anywhere that lightness yet sweetness is desired.<br /><br />I also enjoyed it in iced teas .....especially my fruited teas like strawberry or orange.....<br /><br />I also used it hot teas as welll---but since it was summer more cold drinks went to table than hot.But it would be great on and in either.<br /><br />I did not try it as a cooking sweetener because of its smaller sized containers....so I cannot recommend it for baking or cooking.<br /><br />I can and whole heartedly DO RECOMMEND it for any type of sweetening  where its to be sprinkled over such as cereal , oatmeals ect.......or in drinks of any type...and fruits as I mentioned earlier !!<br /><br />NO bad tasted only nice sweetness !!"
967,1351209600,B007TGO1TY,A2LEO7WT1VIMKZ,5,This stuff is great!,"I'm surprised to see so many negative comments about this product. I don't notice any kind of aftertaste nor do I notice this ""cooling effect"". So far I've only had this by itself (just to taste it) and in coffee. Both experiences were positive. Look, it's not really that much money to try it, so if you want to avoid sugar and don't want something like Slenda (or Stevia -- yuck!) then why not give Nectresse a try?"
968,1351209600,B005IOXBY0,A1ORVAUR5C5N8X,5,WOW.....,"This chocolate is amazing..I love the taste and smell, this is the only chocolate for me...I found a new love!"

My husband had installed the same one in our old house so when our current faucet was leaking I told him not to fix it and we would buy the same one.  It was easy enough for him to install but he did need my assistance a few times to help hold some things in place. Looks great and works great.
970,1351209600,B000255OIG,A3SSEJ8IEM4YGW,5,Dogs love it.,"This is the ""all gone"" treat after dinner.  It's the only treat that the dogs work for; and I did run the chance of losing a hand.  They know a new command now:  ""be gentle"" when taking liver treats."
971,1351209600,B000IHNCQO,A2DFSA2JXQKVY3,4,Not bad.,"These are small and very salty. The taste is good, but very strong, so it's a good thing the package contains a small amount. It only takes a few little crisps to cure my salty/crunchy craving. I can snack on one package for an entire day. Of course these would not be a good snack if you're very hungry, because there isn't enough there to fill you up. For less than $1 per pack it's an okay deal."
972,1351209600,B005C7R8HE,A3MAVAV6Q37XT5,5,super,I love this coffee!  And such a great price.  Will buy more when I am running out which will be soon.
973,1351209600,B003Z6W32E,A2GW6JUVTALDPV,1,I did not receive my order,"I placed my order through Amazon and after about 10 days inquired about my order because it had not shipped.  I received an email back from Starbucks that my order had been canceled. No explanation at all, just that it had been canceled. I checked back on Amazon and see that this item is still available but they had raised the price.<br /><br />So instead of honoring the price they just blew me off like the sale never happened.  Shame on Amazon for allowing a seller to do this.<br /><br />Bottom line, Amazon has gone down a few points in my eyes.  Greedy Starbucks can keep their coffee."
974,1351209600,B00934SOFM,A37WARPJ0CCFHU,5,Love It!,"If you've never had a BCalm before, you've gotta try it.  It's really the perfect drink for relaxation.  Good for a stressful day in the office, a day at the beach, or pretty much anywhere you are.  As a commercial director, I'm on set all the time.  And while coffee is great early in the morning, there's really nothing better than a BCalm (or two) in the afternoon.  Keeps me going, while putting me at ease.  Definitely give it a shot!"
975,1351209600,B004ZY34NC,A4IL0CLL27Q33,1,Buyer beware,"Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here)."
976,1351209600,B0002LY6W0,A1BX08Y0GIT5RU,5,The BEST fig spread on the market,This is my go to spread when I serve a cheese platter.  This goes well with soft cheeses like goat or brie.  Spread it on a cracker or a slice of a baguette.  Simply delicious.  It's worth every penny.  The texture is perfect and it's not too sweet. I highly recommend this product.
977,1351209600,B0002YW26E,A506HOOCVL8GW,5,You won't believe what you'll catch!,"I have been using this product for many years.  It is a great non-poisonous method of controlling the insect population in and around your house.<br /><br />I could not believe all that I caught.  Spiders, roaches, earwigs, a poor lizard, more spiders, more bugs...  Just put them in corners along the baseboard and check them periodically.  Mine filled up in no time with nasty critters.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this item if you are looking to catch bugs."
978,1351209600,B000WSHV1Q,A1YT628H711FN7,5,Great Treat,My cats love these. They are very hard to find anywhere but here. They used to be available in the pet stores but no longer. Must refrigerate after opening. They are a little pricy but a healthy treat for your cat.
979,1351209600,B000LNC3YM,A1AFTFG64H6UYH,5,Hoping it's all it promises to be!,"The tea leaves arrived in perfect condition with clear instructions for use.  I've made and drank two batches of the tea ( each makes four 8-oz cups) and I assume all the health-giving properties are doing their thing!  The tea itself is bland and pretty tasteless.  I drink it icy cold and it's like drinking water - no better, no worse.  People can add sweetener and drink it hot or warm also, but I just drink it in place of one of my usual water beverages because that is what I prefer.  It's a health drink and I can't imagine anyone disliking it, and that's the main thing.  You don't have to hold your nose and choke it down.  It's fine."
980,1351209600,B008GQ40UQ,A1YDQ8I5KVNF8P,5,More Like Pepsi,"There is a lot of cola syrups trying to be Coke but this one is shooting for Pepsi. It comes close to Pepsi but of course not a bull eye just like cola syrups can't be Coke, both Coke and Pepsi own the recipes for their drinks. Now that said this is  a very good tasting syrup and not a hard or sweet taste like other cola syrups but more mild flavor. My sister is a big Pepsi drinker and she likes this lot more that other cola syrups, she doesn't like Coke. I think we will be sticking with, it seems this is the only syrup trying to be like Pepsi. Again got the package in great shape and very fast, just wish the shipping could be lower. So if you're not a Coke drinker and want a syrup more like Pepsi, you found it!"
981,1351209600,B000NCXHFA,ATMTE0BSP7W6S,5,Mung Beans for sprouting,"I wanted to feed my chickens, turkeys and goats just a little extra protein to keep them fit and healthy while the goats are pregnant over the winter and the chickens and turkeys are getting ready for breeding season.  Sprouts seemed like a good idea but everytime I tried to sprout regular beans they would go bad before the sprouts were big enough to interest the poultry.  So I saw that the ones I was eating out of can were grown from mung beans.  Never heard of them before but thought I'd give it a try.  The beans took longer to get here than I would have liked (almost two weeks) but that just tells me the time frame I need before I order more.  And the beans!!!!  Oh my goodness, you'll get 100% germination and sprouts that are easily eaten and really quite yummy in just three days.  I need to get a bigger growing apparatus so that I can make more at one time.  The chickens, turkeys, goats and even my pregnant cow LOVE the sprouts.  I've found the extra source of protein I needed.  Thanks so much."
982,1351209600,B005XGH78E,A2YGWCOC3LM3KH,5,Great flavor - spicy but not too hot,"I got some of this from a low sodium foods website. I can't believe how much flavor this has for only 170mg per oz.  I am on a strict low sodium diet and I don't like foods where they have simply left out salt (bland) or they cheat and add potassium chloride, something just as bad as salt to my diet. So I am constantly on the hunt for low sodium foods that are naturally that way. This is a perfect cure for my salty food cravings. I haven't tried the other flavors yet but I plan to."

In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.  We found Pill Pockets is the very best way to do this.  Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.  Everybody is happy, and the dogs get the required meds."

My personal favorites are the flavored blends. (: Thanks!"
