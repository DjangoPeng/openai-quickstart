## Introduction

OpenAI Translator is an AI-powered translation tool designed to translate English PDF books to Chinese. The tool leverages large language models (LLMs) like ChatGLM and OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo for translation. It's built in Python and has a flexible, modular, and object-oriented design. 

## Why this project

In the current landscape, there's a lack of non-commercial yet efficient PDF translation tools. Many users have PDF documents with sensitive data that they prefer not to upload to public commercial service websites due to privacy concerns. This project was developed to address this gap, providing a solution for users who need to translate their PDFs while maintaining data privacy.

### Sample Results

The OpenAI Translator is still in its early stages of development, and I'm actively working on adding more features and improving its performance. We appreciate any feedback or contributions!

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1.Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:DjangoPeng/openai-translator.git`.

2.The `OpenAI-Translator` requires Python 3.10 or later. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3.Set up your OpenAI API key(`$OPENAI_API_KEY`). You can either add it to your environment variables or specify it in the config.yaml file.

### Usage

You can use OpenAI-Translator either by specifying a configuration file or by providing command-line arguments.

#### Using a configuration file:

Adapt `config.yaml` file with your settings:

```yaml
model_name: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
input_file: "tests/test.pdf"
output_file_format: "markdown"
source_language: "English"
target_language: "Chinese"
```

Then run the tool:

```bash
python ai_translator/main.py
```

#### Using command-line arguments:

You can also specify the settings directly on the command line. Here's an example of how to use the OpenAI model:

```bash
# Set your api_key as an env variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxx"
python ai_translator/main.py --model_name "gpt-3.5-turbo" --input_file "your_input.pdf" --output_file_format "markdown" --source_language "English" --target_language "Chinese"
```
