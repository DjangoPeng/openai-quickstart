This project is designed as a one-stop learning resource for anyone interested in large language models and their application in Artificial Intelligence Governance and Control (AIGC) scenarios. By providing theoretical foundations, development basics, and hands-on examples, this project offers comprehensive guidance on these cutting-edge topics.

## Features

- **Theory and Development Basics of Large Language Models**: Deep dive into the inner workings of large language models like GPT-4, including their architecture, training methods, applications, and more.

- **AIGC Application Development with LangChain**: Hands-on examples and tutorials using LangChain to develop AIGC applications, demonstrating the practical application of large language models.

## Getting Started

You can start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DjangoPeng/openai-quickstart.git
```

Then navigate to the directory and follow the individual module instructions to get started.
