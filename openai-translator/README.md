## Introduction

OpenAI Translator is an AI-powered translation tool designed to translate English PDF books to Chinese. The tool leverages large language models (LLMs) like ChatGLM and OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo for translation. It's built in Python and has a flexible, modular, and object-oriented design. 

## Why this project

In the current landscape, there's a lack of non-commercial yet efficient PDF translation tools. Many users have PDF documents with sensitive data that they prefer not to upload to public commercial service websites due to privacy concerns. This project was developed to address this gap, providing a solution for users who need to translate their PDFs while maintaining data privacy.

### Sample Results

The OpenAI Translator is still in its early stages of development, and I'm actively working on adding more features and improving its performance. We appreciate any feedback or contributions!

## Features

- [X] Translation of English PDF books to Chinese using LLMs.
- [X] Support for both [ChatGLM](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) models.
- [X] Flexible configuration through a YAML file or command-line arguments.
- [X] Timeouts and error handling for robust translation operations.
- [X] Modular and object-oriented design for easy customization and extension.
- [ ] Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
- [ ] Add support for batch processing of multiple PDF files.
- [ ] Create a web service or API to enable usage in web applications.
- [ ] Add support for other languages and translation directions.
- [ ] Add support for preserving the original layout and formatting of the source PDF.
- [ ] Improve translation quality by using custom-trained translation models.


## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DjangoPeng/openai-translator.git
```

2. Prepare the Python environment:
- Required Python version: python > 3.10.13
  - If you don’t have a separate environment, please refer to [Install and Manage Python with Miniconda](../docs/FAQ/miniconda%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85python.md)
- Install dependencies (make sure you have created a Python environment named myenv with Miniconda and activated it)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the translation program
Choose one of the following methods to start:

- Command-line startup (recommended), using the OpenAI model:
```bash
# Replace 'sk-xxx' with your actual OPENAI_API_KEY
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxx"
python ai_translator/main.py --model_type OpenAIModel --openai_api_key $OPENAI_API_KEY --file_format markdown --book tests/test.pdf --openai_model gpt-3.5-turbo
```
You will see the result:

- YAML configuration file startup, using the OpenAI model Adjust the config.yaml file according to your settings:
```yaml
OpenAIModel:
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  api_key: "sk-xxx"

GLMModel:
  model_url: "your_chatglm_model_url"
  timeout: 300

common:
  book: "test/test.pdf"
  file_format: "markdown"
```

Execute the command:
```bash
python ai_translator/main.py --config config.yaml --model_type OpenAIModel
```

- Command-line startup, using the GLM model:
```bash
export GLM_MODEL_URL="http://xxx:xx"
python ai_translator/main.py --model_type GLMModel --glm_model_url $GLM_MODEL_URL --book tests/test.pdf 
```
